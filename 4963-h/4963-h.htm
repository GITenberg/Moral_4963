    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dr. Ludwig Thoma, perhaps better known to his Bavarian countrymen as Peter
      Schlemiehl, was born in Oberammergau on January 21, 1867. After graduating
      from a gymnasium in Munich, he studied at the School of Forestry at
      Aschauffenburg. He did not finish his course there, but entered the
      University at Munich and received his degree as Doctor Juris in 1893.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year later Dr. Thoma began to practice law; but he abandoned that
      pursuit in 1899 to follow a career for which his inclinations and talents
      so happily fitted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been writing humorous verses for Simplicissimus for several years
      under the pen name of Pete Schlemiehl, with such success that the paper
      almost became identified by that name. These poems were later published in
      book form under the title&mdash;Grobheiten.
    </p>
    <p>
      His prose writings in Bavarian dialect as well as his boyhood experiences
      entitled, Lausbubengeschichten, won a large and warm audience. In 1899 he
      became the editor of Simplicissimus. From then on his renown grew. The
      foremost critics of German letters began to take notice of this "Bavarian
      Aristophanes" and to compare him to Heine and the classics.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Moral and Lottchen's Birthday appeared, while the reviewers shook
      their heads and stated that Dr. Thoma was shocking (so in original) they
      concluded that their author was "casting a long shadow." To-day Dr. Thoma
      is a recognized figure in Germany. Prof. Robert F. Arnold in "Das Moderne
      Drama" (Strassburg, 1908) ranks him next to Hauptmann. His writings are
      numerous. A vein, satirical and humorous, with a conception of the
      pathetic, makes him more than an equal to Mark Twain. In addition he is
      possessed of a message, which he delivers in the Moral.
    </p>
    <p>
      First produced in 1908 the play soon became a part and parcel of the
      repertoire of the leading theatres in Germany. It was put on for the first
      time in New York, in German, at the Irving Place Theatre in the spring of
      1914, through the efforts of the late Heinrich Matthias and the writer.
      Mr. Matthias then played the part of Beermann. Mr. Christians, the
      director, repeated the performance a number of times that season, each
      performance meeting with a warm response.
    </p>
    <p>
      The late Percival Pollard was the first American critic to emphasize the
      importance of Dr. Thoma's work in his excellent resume of contemporary
      German literature: Masks and Minstrels of Modern Germany. He pointed out
      "that no country where hypocrisy or puritanism prevail as factors in the
      social and municipal conduct should be spared the corrective acid of this
      play."
    </p>
    <p>
      H. L. Mencken and George Jean Nathan for many years have sung praises of
      the Moral in the Smart Set. But its production on the English speaking
      stage still remains an event eagerly to be awaited. Briefly, the play is a
      polemic against the "men higher up," churchmen, reformers, and social
      hypocrites.
    </p>
    <p>
      The translation follows the text implicitly. Four different versions were
      made all varying in a degree from the original, and although Dr. Thoma
      wrote to the writer "bin auch damit einverstanden dass Sie in der
      Ubersetzung meines Schauspieles 'Moral' etwaige Aenderungen oder
      Adaptiereungen, die durch die englisch-amerikanischen Verhaltnisse und den
      Geschmack des amerikanischen Theatrepublikums geboten erscheinen, in
      entsprechender Weise vornehmen ..." it was deemed best for purposes of
      publication to try to preserve the original atmosphere without an attempt
      to even transpose such phrases as Gnadige Frau, or Herr Kommerzienrat.

      THE PRESUMPTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      The esteemed, sensitive public will assume that the action takes place in
      Emilsburg, the capital of the Duchy of Gerlestein. The first and third
      acts occur in the house of Herr Fritz Beermann; the second act, in the
      Police Headquarters. It all happens between Sunday afternoon and Monday
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be free from blame, the producers will please note that:
    </p>

      chin carefully shaved.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN is in the late forties, though youthful looking for her age.
    </p>

      FURTHER APOLOGY
    </h3>
    <p>
      (Card room in Beermann's house. In the background a swinging door opens
      into the dining room. To the right a smaller door leads to the music room.
      On the left side another door opens into the entrance hall. To left
      upstage in a corner a small card table with chairs. To right upstage a
      large sofa and comfortable chairs. Parallel to background down stage, tea
      table with coffee service thereon; near it to right, smaller table, on it
      a humidor.
    </p>
    <p>
      A butler is engaged at the tea table, another man servant is holding
      swinging door open. [Business of getting up from table.] Many voices and
      rattle of chairs are heard from dining room. Through swinging doors enters
      Bolland and Frau Beermann, Beermann with Frau Bolland, Dr. Hauser with
      Effie, Dr. Wasner with Fraulein Koch-Pinneberg, Dobler alone.)
    </p>
    <p>
      General greeting of "Mahlzeit."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Wasner is vigorously shaking hands&mdash;going to Frau Beermann says,
      "Ich wunsche Gesegnete Mahlzeit."
    </p>
    <p>
      The servants pass around coffee&mdash;Beermann conversing with Bolland
      comes down stage ...
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. You will receive two thousand votes more than the Socialists.
      That's certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [skeptical]. No,&mdash;no.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. If all the Liberals combine with the Conservatives, the result
      cannot be in doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [taking coffee from the servant]. If ...
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. Fusion is here. It's the logical development. I am an old
      politician. The time for discussion is over. Now it's a straight fight to
      a finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER [coming nearer]. The German fatherland is rallying to the
      support of the national flag.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. But there are controversies everywhere. I know best. I always am
      told by campaign managers: don't say this and don't say that.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. In what way?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. For instance, I'm to speak at the Liberal Club the day after
      to-morrow. You would not expect me to say the same things I told the
      Conservatives last night ...?
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. Your details, of course, must differ. But fundamentally it
      amounts to the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. The same thing? Believe me, all this masking confuses me.
      [Drinks.]
    </p>
    <p>
      EFFIE [calling across the tea table where she has been standing with
      others]. Papa! Listen to Frau Bolland. She also says that the Indian
      Dancer is so interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BOLLAND. Positively won&mdash;derful, Herr Bolland! You can conceive
      the entire spirit of the Orient.
    </p>
    <p>
      EFFIE. Why haven't we gone to see her?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BOLLAND. You surely ought to go. Professor Stohr&mdash;you know him&mdash;told
      me he never in his life saw anything so gorgeous.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAULEIN KOCH-PINNEBERG. She's so picturesque in her greenish gowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BOLLAND. I did not know that the Hindoos could be so charming.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. We'll have a look at her some night.
    </p>
    <p>
      EFFIE. But to-morrow night is her last appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [going to the humidor]. Very well darling. Will you remind me of
      it to-morrow? [Taking a box of cigars offers one to Dobler who is standing
      near him.] Smoke?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOBLER [taking one]. Thanks. But I am not accustomed to the imported ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [patronizingly]. You'll get used to high living soon enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND [to Dobler]. How long have you been in the city now?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOBLER. Two years.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. And before that you were in ... eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BOLLAND. You must excuse him Herr Dobler. Why in Unterschlettenbach,
      dear ... You know that!
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND [correcting himself]. Certainly. Bit of literary history. Mighty
      interesting place that Unterschlettenbach ... eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOBLER. Hardly, Herr Kommerzienrat. Poor and unsanitary. Most of its
      inhabitants are miners.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. Fancy that! And I never knew it. Full of miners! Tell me though,
      what do you think of our set here ...? How do you like this well-to-do
      circle ... the big city ... wealthy surroundings?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOBLER [lighting a cigar]. I like it well enough. But I think I will
      always feel out of place here.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. Can't get used to it?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOBLER. Everything is so different. It seems to me at times as though I
      had suddenly entered a beautiful house while outdoors my old comrade was
      awaiting me patiently&mdash;the open road.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BOLLAND. Isn't that won&mdash;derful? So very re-a-lis-tic-ally put!
      I can just picture it. Oh Herr Dobler ... I must tell you: your novel&mdash;my
      husband and I talk about it all day long.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. Tell me though&mdash;did you yourself experience the life of that
      young man you describe?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOBLER. It's the story of my youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. But it's somewhat colored by poetic imagination?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOBLER. N&mdash;-o.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. For instance, you have never actually starved?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOBLER. Oh, yes. There's no imagination in that.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. Just the way you describe it&mdash;so that everything turned red?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOBLER. Everything had a pink color. On one occasion I did not eat
      anything for four and one-half days.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN [compassionately]. You poor thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BOLLAND. That's exceedingly interesting!
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. Do tell us all about it! Then you saw dancing fires?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOBLER. Yes. Everything danced before my eyes, and I saw it all through a
      hazy veil, and towards the end my hearing was affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. You don't say so? Your hearing also?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOBLER. When any one spoke to me it sounded as if he stood a great
      distance off&mdash;a great distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BOLLAND. Our set never dreams of such things.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. How did it all turn out?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOBLER. What do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Well, in the end you got something to eat again?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOBLER. Finally I fainted; I was found lying in a meadow, and was taken to
      the hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN [sighing]. Are such things still possible in our day?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BOLLAND. What can you expect&mdash;of these idealists! DR. HAUSER.
      They deserve nothing better.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. And after you were in the hospital&mdash;how did you get out?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOBLER. As soon as I got stronger. Later on I became a printer&mdash;found
      a position&mdash;studied and published my book.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. That's all in your novel, I know. But the part where you
      describe how you were a tramp&mdash;that's not true?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOBLER. Yes, I "hoboed" almost a whole year.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BOLLAND. "Hoboed!" Fancy that! How unique!
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAULEIN KOCH-PINNEBERG. I can just picture it. Tramping along the
      railroad tracks.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOBLER. Yes. You folks think you can picture it with four square meals a
      day. But it's quite different, I assure you. There were three of us at
      that time. We worked our way from Basel upwards&mdash;sometimes on the
      left&mdash;sometimes on the right bank of the Rhine. In Worms we spent the
      last of our money and we had to PEDDLE for HAND-OUTS.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BOLLAND [not understanding him]. "Handouts?" What is that?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOBLER [with pathos]. To beg for something to eat, gnadige Frau, for our
      daily bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      [They all remain silent. Only the voice of the butler who is serving
      liqueur can be heard.] "Cognac monsieur! Chartreuse! Champagne?"
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [taking a glass]. To a man of refinement, such an existence must
      have been quite unbearable.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOBLER [taking a glass of cognac from the butler]. Unpleasant. [Drinking.]
      But you lose your sensitiveness. At first it is hard&mdash;but one learns.
      In one hot day on the road ... when you get fagged out&mdash;and with
      every stone hurting your feet&mdash;you'll learn. The dust blinds you&mdash;but
      you've got to go on just the same. In the evening you come to a small
      hamlet with smoke curling above the house-tops and the houses themselves
      look cozy&mdash;then you have to hold your hat in your hand and beg for a
      plate of warm soup. [A short pause.]
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER [deep bass voice]. Home sweet home!
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. The story reminds me exactly of my late father.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BOLLAND. But, Adolph!
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. Indeed, I say it does!
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BOLLAND. How can you draw such a comparison? Herr Dobler has become a
      celebrated poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. My father also achieved something in life. At his funeral four
      hundred employees followed the coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BOLLAND [impatiently]. We've heard that before ... Herr Dobler, did
      you write poetry in those days?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOBLER. No, Frau Bolland. Much later.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BOLLAND. I'll have to read your novel all over again, now that I know
      it is all autobiographical.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN [to Dr. Wasner]. You were going to sing, Herr Professor?
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER. I promised ...
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. Yes, do, Effie will accompany you.
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER. If Fraulein will be so kind ... but I don't know how my voice
      is to-day ...
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BOLLAND. You sing so beauti-ful-ly.
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER. So much campaign work. Politics corrupts even the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAULEIN KOCH-PINNEBERG. Do oblige us.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Frau Bolland, Frau Beermann, Dr. Wasner, Fraulein Koch, Effie go out into
      the music room.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. It's a pity that the professor is going to sing. We could have
      started a game of skat. Have some more cognac?
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. HAUSER. No, thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOBLER. Thanks. No more for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Bolland seats himself on sofa; Dr. Hauser and Dobler sit in chairs;
      Beermann lights a fresh cigar. The butler goes into the music room and as
      he opens the door, the sound of the piano is heard.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. As I said before Herr Dobler, your story reminded me very much of
      my late father.
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. HAUSER. Of the well known Kommerzienrat Bolland?
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND [sinks deep into chair; crosses legs]. Never mind he was not
      always a wealthy Kommerzienrat. [Turning to Dobler.] Picture to yourself a
      winter landscape&mdash;it's bitter cold&mdash;a gray sky&mdash;it is
      snowing and everything is wrapped in snow. Through all this we see a youth
      walking&mdash;rather staggering&mdash;along the forest road from
      Perleberg. A half starved young man. [He pauses and brushes ashes from his
      cigar. The butler enters from the music room to get a glass of water; then
      he goes out again. While the door is open, the trembling bass baritone
      voice of Prof. Wasner is heard.]
    </p>
    <p>
      "In deinen Augen hab ich einst gelesen Von Lieb' und&mdash;Gluck&mdash;von
      Lieb' und Gluck den Schein...."
    </p>
    <p>
      [Footnote: (Translated):&mdash;"In thy dear eyes I once read the story Of
      love and Joy&mdash;of Love, And Joy agleam...."]
    </p>
    <p>
      [The door closes and the sound is shut off.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND [now continues his speech]. And now the snow falls faster and
      faster. This poor young man had par tout nothing to eat since the morning.
      He becomes very weak; sits down on a bundle of twigs and falls asleep.
      Just by sheer chance it happens that a man from Perleberg passing by sees
      this dejected, snowed-in figure and takes the young fellow home with him.
      [He pauses.] And this young man later became my father ...
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. And Herr Kommerzienrat Bolland.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. Yes. Herr Kommerzienrat Bolland. [To Dobler.] Now don't you
      consider it quite remarkable? Wouldn't that make a fine novel?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOBLER. Yes ... Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. That could be worked up very nicely, couldn't it? A poor young
      man&mdash;the snow covered landscape ...
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. And that bundle of twigs.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOBLER. Fortune has her unique whims and likes to turn the tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. That's it exactly. Fortune delights in turning the tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Unique whims? No. That sort of thing happens every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. What happens every day?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. The story of a poor young man who becomes a millionaire. Every
      large factory boasts of a like progenitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. Do you think so?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. And the poor young man grows poorer with each telling. Your son,
      Herr Bolland, in his description will have his grandfather freeze to death
      on the bundle of twigs.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. Upon my word the story is gospel. [To Dobler.] I'd make use of
      that plot ... How he founded his business and how it grew and grew ...
    </p>
    <p>
      [As Frau Beermann enters from the music room, the tremulous voice of Prof.
      Wasner is heard.]
    </p>
    <p>
      "Behuet dich Gott, es hat nicht sollen sein." [Footnote: God guard thee
      well, it was but a dream.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [The closing of the door shuts off the sound.]
    </p>
    <p>
      DOBLER. In one respect you are right. The character of the SELF MADE MAN
      [Footnote: So in original.] has hardly been treated in contemporary German
      literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND [with enthusiasm]. That's just what I claim. Always about the poor
      people only. But take a man who has a large income&mdash;one who makes a
      success of his business, that also is poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. I'd have my ledger novelized, if I were you, Holland. [A maid
      opens door, admitting Frau Lund.]
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN [welcoming Frau Lund]. Mama Lund, how good of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND [vivaciously]. Always glad to come here. Good afternoon,
      gentlemen. Where is my little Effie?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. In the music room. [To the maid.] Please tell my daughter
      ...
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. No, no, don't disturb her.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Permit me. [Introducing.] ... Herr Hans Jacob Dobler, our famous
      poet ...
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND [taking his hand]. A famous poet? Delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. Author of "Life Story of Hans." ...
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND [pleasantly to Dobler]. If I were younger, Herr Dobler, I would
      certainly make believe that I read your book. But at my age I find that
      sort of thing too tiresome. What is the "Life Story of Hans"?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOBLER. It is a novel, gnadige Frau.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. A masterpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. Then my ignorance is unpardonable. I'll soon make reparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Frau Bolland followed by Effie, Dr. Wasner and Fraulein Koch hurry out of
      the music room.]
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BOLLAND. I am off for the Arts Club. I'll be late, I fear. [To Frau
      Lund.] Oh, how do you do, Frau Lund?
    </p>
    <p>
      EFFIE [hurries over to Frau Lund and kisses her hand]. Mama Lund!
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. How is my little mischief maker? When are you coming to see me?
    </p>
    <p>
      EFFIE. I would glady come ... but, I am so busy with music lessons and
      Professor Stohr's lectures ...
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. And this and that and your eighteen years. You are quite right,
      my dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BOLLAND [to Frau Beermann]. May Effie come along? They say there are
      very won-der-ful paintings at the Arts Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN [turning to Frau Lund], I don't know if ...
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. Of course, let her go along. She has such a pretty little
      dress. Why should she be here with us old people? The gentlemen will
      entertain us ...
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BOLLAND. But then we'll have to hurry. It is quite late. Goodbye,
      Frau Beermann. I enjoyed myself so much. Goodbye, my dear Frau Lund. So
      glad to have seen you again. Goodbye, goodbye ... Adolph!
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. Yes, Mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BOLLAND. You won't forget the theatre tonight? At eight. The Viennese
      actor is so fine. [Off to left. Followed by Effie and Fraulein Koch. Frau
      Bolland in the doorway.]
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BOLLAND. Will you come with us, Herr Dobler? You can explain so many
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOBLER. I'll be glad to. [Shaking hands with Frau Beermann and bowing.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Come soon again, Herr Poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. And think over the story I told you.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Dobler goes out left, following Frau Bolland, Effie, and Fraulein Koch.]
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND [to Frau Beermann]. I'll just have a cup of coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. I'll tell them to make a fresh cup for you. A fresh cup of
      coffee. [To the butler who is clearing the table.] Tell the chef&mdash;[Butler
      goes out through the middle door. In the meantime Frau Holland again
      appears through left.]
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BOLLAND. Adolph!
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. Yes&mdash;wifey?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BOLLAND. Thursday the circus comes to town, don't forget to reserve
      seats.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. All right!
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BOLLAND [while going out]. I'm still a child when the circus comes.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Frau Lund seats herself on sofa. Next to her on the right Frau Beermann;
      Beermann and Bolland sit opposite in large leather chairs. Hauser is
      standing behind the sofa leaning against it.]
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND [to Hauser]. Tell me Judge, where have you been keeping yourself
      all this time?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. In my office, Frau Lund, only in my office. But I hear that you
      were on the Riviera.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. Four weeks in Monte Carlo. Children, I gambled like an old
      viveur.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. What luck?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. I lost, of course&mdash;I'm too old to set the world on fire.
      But, Beermann, I hear all sorts of surprises about you. You are a
      candidate for the Reichstag?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Yes, they nominated me.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. Who are "they"?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. The combined Liberals and Conservatives ...
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. And the Conservatives and Liberals combined.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. Formerly these were distinct parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Formerly,&mdash;formerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Now there is fusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND [to Frau Beermann]. You never told me that your husband was in
      politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. He never was&mdash;up to two weeks ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. How quickly things change! And of all the people ... you!
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. What's so startling in that?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. You told me that you never even read the newspapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. We all are cordially grateful to Beermann that in an hour of need
      he made this sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. The way you talk about the "hour of need" and "sacrifice" Herr
      Kommerzienrat, it seems to me that you would have been the better
      candidate.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. Oh, I am too pronouncedly Liberal.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. And that's an incurable disease!
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. At any rate it makes my nomination impossible. A man was needed
      who was not known as a party-man.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. It would seem then that our friend Beermann has become a
      politician because he ... is no politician?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. That's what is known as "fusion."
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Allow me to ask a question. Why should I not become a Reichstag
      deputy?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Quite right! Frau Lund&mdash;tell him&mdash;why shouldn't he?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Because I am a novice in politics? We all have to make a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. It's the only calling where one can start any day, Frau Lund,
      without being called upon to produce qualifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. There you can tell the lawyer. You'd like to establish a civil
      service examination for members of the Reichstag?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. You are not afraid that it might hurt them?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [with importance]. Let me tell you, Judge. What a person achieves
      in real life is far greater than all your book wisdom. We have too many
      lawyers anyway. It's one of our national misfortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND [merrily to Frau Beermann]. Look! He's beginning to debate
      already.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND [careless pose]. As you know, I run a soap factory where I employ
      four hundred and sixty-two workmen ... let me repeat it, four hundred and
      sixty-two workmen. Their livelihood and welfare lies in the palm of my
      hand; don't you think that requires brains?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. But ...
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND [interrupting]. Do you realize what the amount of detail and the
      management of the whole factory means?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. But friend Beermann never even worked in a soap factory. How can
      that apply to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Oh, what's the use of discussing things if you're joking.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Really, I can't see the connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. At any rate, I'm a better candidate than the book-binder whom
      the Socialists have put up against me.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. Beermann has had greater experience and has a broader point of
      view.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. Then there's something else I heard about Herr Beermann, that I
      don't like at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. About me?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. Yes, I bear that you are the President of the new Society for
      the Suppression of Vice. What makes you do such things? That isn't nice.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. I fully agree with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. You do? For what reasons? When honest men select me as their
      President, is that mere flattery?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. It is not becoming to you, and you are insincere in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. It's as false as anything can be, and you speak about
      problems which you have never understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Pardon me! I ought to know best what is becoming for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. There's no one in the world I dislike as much as a preacher.
      But if a person wants to be one ... then, according to the gospel he ought
      to live on bread and water. It doesn't go well with champagne and lobster.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Do the Scriptures command that we must be poor to be honorable?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. No, Beermann, but if I still remember, they speak of a camel
      and a needle.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. The ladies evidently are not acquainted with the purposes of our
      new society. I am sure they would subscribe to every one of the principles
      which are incorporated in our By-laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. I certainly would not.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND [feeling in his side pocket]. At least read our "Appeal to the
      Public."
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND [refusing]. No, thank you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. Every woman will rejoice when she reads it.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. Do you think so? How exceedingly amusing your societies are!
      So, cards and bowling no longer offer sufficient entertainment. You have
      to moralize.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. I can't help thinking of the notorious starvation freak at the
      circus who gets his meals on the sly everyday.
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER. Of course, every conviction can be made ridiculous once it's
      regarded as insincere. You shouldn't accuse without proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Herr Professor, politeness requires that each individual be
      regarded as the exception&mdash;but not an entire club.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. It is a pity, indeed, that a great movement like ours is disposed
      of by a few trifling remarks. That embitters our task of curing the nation
      of social diseases.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. Where did you get your Doctor's license to cure?
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER. It's sad enough that the cure is left to only a few of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Well, I'll remain a patient. You'll need a few anyway to keep up
      your business.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. I consider all this a very cheap kind of humor. I used to joke
      about these matters myself, but if you will only look upon this problem
      from a serious point of view, when your eyes are opened to the ...
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN.... Your newly acquired ways of talking are quite
      unbearable.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Please, don't make a scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. We have been married for twenty-six years; have been very
      fortunate with our own children. Why worry about other people?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. You are not logical, my love. The mere fact that I brought up my
      children properly is all the more reason for my joining this movement....
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. You didn't lose much sleep about their education.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Evidently I didn't neglect anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. I'm afraid you pride yourselves on a degree of willpower you
      never exercised.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Never exercised? My dear Frau Lund, what do you know about the
      temptations which confront us men. What does a woman know about them?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. The only thing we women don't know about is the manner in which
      these temptations terminate.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Our movement intends to do away with these very deceptions. We
      want to protect the traditions of the home which women treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. No. We, women also treasure modesty. We dislike to see men
      pretend to have better morals than they actually have.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Seriously, Frau Lund. Public immorality must hurt you more.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. You are mistaken. It requires a genuine manly feeling to
      sympathize with misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER. Misery and vice are different problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. They're not. And that is why we will never agree.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. All the more reason why my husband should not set himself
      up as an example. He knows nothing of worry or care.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. We can never subscribe to Frau Lund's principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. No principles, please!
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. Out of sheer opposition you will say that you hold different ones
      from us.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. No. I will say that I hold none at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. and WASNER [together]. But, gnadige Frau!
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. I can't help it. I lost them some place on my journey through
      life. I have learned that all your principles have loop holes through
      which people can conveniently slip out and take their friends along with
      them. So I had my choice of either surrendering them or dishonestly
      preaching them to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER. Real principles of life are never given up.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER [with sarcasm]. Cheers from the gallery!
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. Principles of morality are the laws of nature&mdash;they are her
      dictates.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. Is that the reason you have started your Society for the
      Suppression of Vice? Do you imagine your by-laws are stronger than the
      laws of nature?
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER. May I make just one remark?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. What is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER [stroking his beard]. In summing up the matter we can come to
      this decision: women have a beautiful privilege. Certain facts in life
      remain a closed book to them. We, men, unfortunately have to come into
      contact with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Did you say UNFORTUNATELY?
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER. Please don't interrupt. I maintain "unfortunately"! For the
      last four years, I have been persistently following obscene literature,
      and to-day I have gotten together a collection of it, which I dare say is
      pretty complete. So I am speaking of matters about which I am thoroughly
      informed. [With importance.] The degree of vulgarity our people have
      reached is incredible.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. And you have been the "persistent collector" of this vulgarity?
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER. Let me assure you that I took upon myself this task with
      loathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Herr Professor, in all my life I have never met a man who for four
      years voluntarily did something which was loathsome to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER. You have no business to make such a remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Have you derived no satisfaction from it at all?
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER. Satisfaction&mdash;if you mean the satisfaction of
      participating in the uplift of our people.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. Uplift? Our reformers capitalize our national lack of good
      taste. Good proof of that are the moral works of art which you patronize.
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER. The matter we are discussing is more serious than reforming
      bad taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. There is nothing more serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER [knowingly]. If you but knew, Frau Lund!
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. I don't have to call and see your collection. Frankly, to me,
      the most obscene picture in your gallery could not be more disgusting than
      the talk you carry on in your meetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Oh! Oh!
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. The nudity of the human body is not disgusting. It is the
      nudity of your mind. No vice is as repulsive as that virtue of yours which
      loudly uncovers itself in public&mdash;in market places. Vice has at least
      the shame to hide itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [to Bolland]. Can you understand her?
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. I must admit, I can't.
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER. Gnadige Frau stated that vice hides itself. But in spite of
      that it exists.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. Yes, she admitted that it exists.
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER. Shall we tolerate it merely because it crawls into dark nooks
      and corners?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. You reformers! Let more sunshine into this world and vice will
      not find so many dark corners and nooks to hide in.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. You would not be as opposed to us if you had a son who would be
      exposed to the temptations of our great cities.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. I would be ashamed of myself if for personal reasons I became
      narrow-minded.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. But just stop to think! Picture a healthy young man in his prime
      falling into the hands of one of these abominable creatures!
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. I could picture something worse than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Still worse?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. For instance, if he should, with all the credulity of youth,
      enter into the work of your society.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. Well! Well!
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. You don't seem to take anything seriously to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. Very seriously; this young man perhaps does reach the stage
      where he sincerely pities your so-called abominable creature. Then he has
      really advanced in his morality. Let the pity impress itself deeply upon
      him and your abominable creature has preached better to him than all your
      high-sounding phrases.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. I am simply dumbfounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER. Then you even believe that our society exerts a bad influence?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND [very positively]. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND [with irony]. Fancy! University Professors, philanthropists and a
      general who are with us in this work&mdash;they are, of course, the ones
      who are likely to corrupt the morals of the younger generation. Frau Lund,
      no doubt, would like to send our young men to the good Ladies of the
      Pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER. In what way is our influence bad?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND [with warmth]. The young man who joins your society does it only
      to ape you and to advance his own ends and vainglory. He forever deprives
      himself of understanding the meaning of life and of becoming helpful to
      those who suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. Well what do you think of such statements?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. They are splendid. I would be very thankful if my boy would
      embody the ideals of Frau Lund.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Lena, I simply forbid you to say such things.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. Really?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Everybody knows that Frau Lund is a radical, but I don't want
      you to fall into that habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. I don't acquire new habits as rapidly as you.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER [to Beermann]. Don't get excited. A politician must give everyone
      an opportunity to express his views.
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER. I teach young people and I heartily wish they'd continue to
      seek their ideals among high minded men and not in the dark city streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. Right! And not in the dark city streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. Nor there, Herr Kommerzienrat, where the veil of shame is
      rudely torn from inborn sensitiveness and it is shorn of every secret
      charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER. Correct! We do want to deprive it of its charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. You succeed in doing that; no tenderness can survive the brutal
      frankness of your meetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER. It is not a national German trait to sugar-coat sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. Why do you confound all lack of refinement with the national
      character?
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER. Because it is good German to call a spade a spade.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [getting up]. Why argue to no purpose? Let's start our game of
      skat.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. Because it appears to be a conflict of two different
      philosophies.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [rises, goes to card table, opens a drawer, takes out a deck of
      cards and opens them]. It's always the same old story. Never start
      anything with women! They must have the last word. [Sits down at card
      table. Bolland gets up and sits beside him.]
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND [laughing]. Spoken again like a typical reformer.
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER [rising]. I don't want to continue this argument, but if by any
      chance you have gained the impression that I regard this matter from a
      prejudiced view point, I will cheerfully admit it. I do.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [calling]. Oh, do come on, Herr Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER [turning to card table]. I'm coming. [To others.] I admit with
      pride that I am prejudiced. For me there exists only one question: How can
      I best serve my fatherland?
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. Herr Professor!
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER [turning to table]. Just a moment.... [To others.] Let the
      sturdy qualities of our people be conserved. That stand is unassailable.
      Then I will be sure that my efforts have at least ...
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [loudly]. But, my dear Wasner!
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER [not dismayed, continuing].... at least a national scope.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Wouldn't you rather play skat, professor?
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER [going over to card table]. There remains only one thing for me to
      say. If I have used sharp words, I want to apologize. [Takes a seat.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. You deal, Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER [shuffling the cards and talking at the same time]. For me
      there exists but one ideal. That which Tacitus described as it once
      prevailed among the old Teutons. Quamquam severa illic matrimonia nec
      ullam morum partem magis laudaveris. [He lets Bolland cut and then deals.]
      The most praiseworthy trait of the Teutons was the strictness of their
      marriage customs. Nam prope soli Barbarorum singulis uxoribus contenti
      sunt. They were almost the only barbarians to content themselves with a
      single wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [loudly]. Tournee!
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. I'll go you!
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Twenty!
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. I'll better that!
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Take it! Gras-Solo!
    </p>
    <p>
      [They play.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [Hauser, Frau Lund, Frau Beermann remain sitting at right.]
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. At last the Fatherland is saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. It's the only occupation for which nature intended them.
      They should not tinker with national problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Have patience. Political ambition dies out after the first defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN.... which I hope will happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. That's as certain as fate. Else he never would have been
      nominated.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [calling from the card table]. I have pretty sharp hearing!
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. A very fine acquisition, Beermann, when you grow old.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND [throwing a card on the table]. Fifty-nine and four make
      sixty-three! The rest you can take.
    </p>
    <p>
      (They throw down their cards; Bolland collects them and shuffles.)
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER [half turning to Hauser], And then there is the celebrated passage,
      "Ergo septa pudicitia agunt, nullis ... spectaculorum illecebris
      corruptae."
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. I have six cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. The bottom one belongs to the Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER [as before, continuing]. So the wife lived surrounded by tenderness
      and care ... and so forth, "Literarum secreta...." Secret communications
      were not tolerated by either husband or wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Please drop that Tacitus. It's your chance to lead....
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER. I pass....
    </p>
    <p>
      HOLLAND. So do I.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND [loudly and enthusiastically]. That's the way to get at them!
      Trumps! And trumps again.
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER [murmuring]. "Paucissima adulteria in tam numerosa gente...."
      [Gradually lapses into silence and then continues to play with energy.]
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND [with a glance towards the card table]. Why do we take our
      principles so seriously.... It's really ridiculous how our every opinion
      soon turns into religious beliefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER. The matter is dead serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. Who will think of it to-morrow?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER [nodding towards card table]. Not they, of course. But there are
      cleverer people. The so-called thinking public in Germany must have some
      national problem to solve. It finds some such, readily enough in order to
      play with it. Meanwhile they take no notice that the party in power
      [Footnote: Men with the brass buttons.] are lining their pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. Haven't they always been doing that?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Yes, but not with such ease. Here and there they were rapped over
      the knuckles. But nowadays they could cart away the entire capitol.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. There's not so much left to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. A couple of pieces anyhow to take along as keepsakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. In my days I saw one reform after another on the bargain
      counter; but we women remain mere spectators while ideals come and go; we
      can not realize how much they mean to men.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. My dear Frau Lund, if a real reform should effectively rise among
      us some day, then you women will have to lend a helping hand. With those
      [nodding towards card-table] kindergarten heroes nothing can be
      accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. What influence can we exert so long as men organize their
      societies for the protection of women's virtue!
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. These henpecked gentlemen always nominate themselves chastity's
      guardians.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. They are of importance only when they can get some one to
      listen. I'd like to go to their meetings and tell them that.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Their meetings&mdash;bosh! Their sort only couple their nonsense
      with a few self-evident generalities which no one would really oppose. No,
      first of all they must be educated and that you women alone can
      accomplish.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. You say that as if we had any influence on public opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. You do all the applauding. The whole game is played for you. If
      you withdraw your applause not a single one of the peacocks of virtue will
      open up his gospel feathers for exhibition. It is indeed of great
      importance to you that they do not banish all refinement from our social
      life.

      with your moralizing? Have we agreed yet&mdash;[Laughing.] Yes; yes; these
      women folks!
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER [arranging cards in his hand]. They were citing Schiller a moment
      ago. We must not forget, ladies, that it was Schiller himself who awakened
      the national spirit of our race.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Your national spirit unfortunately found its way into the
      strangest kinds of containers.
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER. I decidedly protest against such a poor opinion. If the
      sincere religious sentiment of the German element ...
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND [interrupting him]. We are waiting for you, Herr Professor. Are
      you finally going to announce your cards?
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. WASNER [continuing his pathetic tone]. I pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. The steady contact with school children keeps our educators
      refreshingly naive. That man still believes in the superiority of the
      Teutonic element.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU LUND. And in the stability of our special German moral standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Until some little scandal crops up again. By the way, we shall
      soon have one right in our city.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN [with interest]. Here?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. To-morrow you'll read all about it in the newspapers. The police
      have made a discovery which may prove more than they bargained for.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. Here? [Beerman, head sideways, listens over his cards.]
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Last night the police arrested a woman who kept a very open house.
      She colored it by going under a fancy French name, and they say only
      entertained the best of society. She kept a diary which fell into the
      hands of the police.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [he leaves his seat, comes forward, right]. A diary?
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND [drops his cards and rises]. What sort of a diary?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Oh! Just a naughty little inventory of all of her visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. What is the name of the lady?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Some French name which sounds to me like rouge.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. I can't understand how you could forget her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOLLAND. I can't either as long as you seem to know all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN [to Beermann]. But, Fritz, why should you worry about it?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Well ... am I the President of the Vice Suppression Society or,
      am I not ...?

      ACT II
    </h2>
    <p>
      (An office at Police Headquarters. To rear on the left stands the
      Assessor's desk. To the right against the wall, the desk of Reisacher, the
      police clerk. Left front is a sofa with two chairs. On the right wall is a
      telephone. Side entrance left. Another entrance in the middle. Stroebel
      and Reisacher are seated with their backs to one another. Stroebel is
      reading a newspaper; Reisacher is writing. Short pause.)
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [half turning]. Reisacher!
    </p>
    <p>
      REISACHER [also turning]. Yes, Herr Assessor.[Footnote: An assessor is a
      petty police official.]
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Are you familiar with the expression "those higher up"?
    </p>
    <p>
      REISACHER. Yes, Herr Assessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. What do you understand by it?
    </p>
    <p>
      REISACHER. Those are the folks who are something and have money somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Is it used to express contempt or class hatred?
    </p>
    <p>
      REISACHER [eagerly]. Well ... well! "The higher ups" are respected.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Are you certain?
    </p>
    <p>
      REISACHER. Absolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      [They both turn around to their former positions; Stroebel continues to
      read, and Reisacher to write. Short pause.]
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [half turning]. Reisacher!
    </p>
    <p>
      REISACHER [does likewise]. Yes, Herr Assessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. After all, it means class hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      REISACHER. No, no.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Pay attention. Here it says [he reads]: "Of course, for those
      higher up there are no laws." That means, I take it, that the rich are
      beyond the control of the law. By "control of the law," I wish you to
      understand I am attacking the humiliating and anarchistic notion that the
      law does not apply equally to rich and poor. Also I want to besmirch the
      rich, by designating them by a slang expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      REISACHER. Yes, Herr Assessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Then how can you say it does not express class hatred and
      contempt?
    </p>
    <p>
      REISACHER. Because, then again, you see, people who have money are
      respected anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. You will never learn to think precisely, Reisacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      REISACHER. Yes, Herr Assessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Both resume their former positions. Short pause. Police Commissioner,
      Freiherr van Simbach, enters left. Stroebel lays aside his paper, rises
      and salutes. Reisacher writes hurriedly.]
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER [Footnote: President of Police, in original.] 'Morning, Herr
      Assessor. [To Reisacher.] Take your work outside, Reisacher, until I have
      finished. [Reisacher exit through middle door.] I want to ask you a few
      questions, Herr Stroebel. [Stroebel bows. The Commissioner during the
      conversation takes center of stage and speaks nonchalantly and somewhat
      drawingly.] I read your report. Day before yesterday, that was on
      Saturday, you ordered the arrest of a certain woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Yes, Commissioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. Well, what about her?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. According to the report of Lieutenant Schmuttermaier, we have in
      our hands a very dangerous person.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. Is that so!
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Within a short time she has almost demoralized our city.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. She has been in the city about three or four years....
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. She has, according to the report.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. In what way has she been dangerous? Did bald headed
      gentlemen loosen up a bit in her house or are there special charges
      against her?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. No special ones, but her whole behavior. She had a beautiful
      apartment in the best residential district. According to the report, the
      neighbors began to talk about her. She dressed in a rather fast and
      fashionable manner....
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. Then because she did not cater to the common people, you
      consider her so terrible?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. No, Commissioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. I thought not. Remember, please, I don't want you to get any
      of the popular ideas about the corruption of our best society. Slit skirts
      cause as much harm. [Stroebel bows.] What is her name?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Ninon De Hauteville. But her real name is Therese Hochstetter.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. H-a-u-t-e V-i-l-l-e?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. She comes of a good family. Her father was a Peruvian consul.
      When he lost his money, she married a consular secretary. He divorced her
      four years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. Indeed. So she is a person of refinement.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. But she has ...
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER.... A demoralizing influence. I know all about that. Tell me,
      what made you arrest her?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [with importance]. Eight days ago, I received a letter severely
      rebuking the police because her place was tolerated....
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. Who was the letter from?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [hesitatingly']. It was ... really ... anonymous.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. I hope that you are very careful about anonymous
      communications.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Generally, I pay little attention to them. But this letter was
      so full of details, I simply had to consider it. Of course, only as a hint
      and I intended to get proof. I gave it to Schmuttermaier and told him to
      keep the Hochstetter woman under strict surveillance. Saturday at noon we
      obtained positive evidence,
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. Then?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Then I ordered Schmuttermaier to raid the place ...
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER.... During which you found a diary in her apartments?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Yes, Commissioner; a diary with the names of her visitors. The
      dates and their social standing. Everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. Have you finished reading it?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. No, sir. I just glanced at it. I only got it from Schmuttermaier
      an hour ago. I was not in the office yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER [thoughtfully]. It's too late to do anything to-day.
      [Consulting his watch.] Let me see. Bring me an exact report of all
      important names contained in the diary ... at ten to-morrow morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Yes, Commissioner, at ten o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. And remember, it's very important that you make this report
      personally. Don't let the clerk see the diary. It has not yet been in his
      hands?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [going to his desk]. No. It's locked up in my desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. Time enough to bring it to me tomorrow morning when you make
      your report.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. How do you want me to get my data, Commissioner? Shall I summon
      the important people involved?
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER [with emphasis]. Only ... the important ... names ... that's
      all. By the way, how far have you gone in the case? Have you taken any
      further steps?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. No. I will examine the Hochstetter woman in a little while....
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. And Schmuttermaier? Has he orders to make any further raids?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Not yet. I want to read the diary first.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. Above all, I do not want him to act without instructions.
      People of no importance like to do important things.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Yes, Commissioner. Your orders will be carried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. Orders? I never give orders. You have your duties to
      perform. I don't care to tell you what to do.... But there must be no
      further raids until I have seen the diary.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Certainly, Commissioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. At the same time, don't neglect your duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. I will do everything necessary for the promotion of public
      decency.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER [who has been pacing the room, turns suddenly.] Public
      decency? Very well, very well.... [Short pause.] We occupy a most peculiar
      position Do we not, Herr Stroebel? [Stroebel bows.] We know fully the
      existing difference between official ... and let me say ... personal
      sensitiveness, do we not? [Stroebel bows in accord.] I mention this merely
      because you spoke of public decency. There is a decency about which you
      and I privately might have most interesting discussions. As far as I am
      concerned, such decency can be without limits. But there is another&mdash;the
      public decency&mdash;which it is our business to police. This has its very
      precise limits. For example, a scandal. Scandal of any description. Am I
      right, Herr Assessor?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [clicks his heels together]. Certainly, Commissioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. That brings me to another matter. For the past few weeks,
      there has been in the city, a so-called Society for the Suppression of
      Vice. Have you any sympathy with these people?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. I know of their aims ...
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. Their aims do not interest me a bit. I mean, do you
      personally cooperate with them?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Not ... yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. Not yet? ... Hem! ... This Society is likely to interest
      itself in this case. If someone comes to see me, Herr Stroebel, I will
      refer him to you. [Stroebel bows.] Kindly bear this one thing in mind.
      These men have political ambition, and are playing to the press. On the
      whole the thing shows conservative tendencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Certainly, Commissioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. Welcome them with open arms. Agree gratefully to every
      suggestion for the betterment of the people, et cetera. Listen with
      respectful appreciation but do nothing further.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [uncertain]. Nothing further? ...
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. No ... nothing further.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Yes, Commissioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. These people must remain assured that they wield a great
      influence. As a matter of fact, they have none at all and it's a good
      thing they haven't.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. So, I may ...
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER.... Do everything you can be responsible for. As a matter of
      principle, I do not like to give orders. You will submit that report then
      [consulting his watch] at ten to-morrow? Good morning! [Goes toward the
      door left, remains standing a moment, then turns around.] You have been
      rather zealous in your work, I must say. [Stroebel bows slightly.] To
      arrest a woman on the strength of an anonymous letter shows excessive
      zeal. [Stroebel bows slightly.] I like to see my men energetic but [clears
      his throat] bear in mind what I just said. Careful of a scandal! Good
      morning! [Exit.]
    </p>
    <p>
      (Stroebel sits down and stares at ceiling. He swings his chair around,
      then whistles. Reisacher comes in through middle door and seats himself at
      his desk. He coughs.)
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [half turning]. Reisacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      REISACHER [does likewise]. Yes, Herr Assessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. How long have you been in the police department?
    </p>
    <p>
      REISACHER. It will be eighteen years this fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. You have seen many a change, no doubt?
    </p>
    <p>
      REISACHER. Surely.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Tell me, how long has our Commissioner been in office?
    </p>
    <p>
      REISACHER. The Commissioner? Oh ... it's seven. No, let me see, it's eight
      years....
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Hem ... do you really suppose he wants us to keep our eyes wide
      open all the time?
    </p>
    <p>
      REISACHER [eagerly]. Certainly. That's what he wants.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Does he? ... [Short pause.] I had an idea he didn't want us to
      be too strict for fear of notoriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      REISACHER [eagerly]. No, no. He certainly would not like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [turns around completely]. Listen, Reisacher, you contradict
      yourself all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      REISACHER [turns around likewise]. I beg your pardon, Herr Stroebel. May I
      suggest ...
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. But you are always contradicting yourself. First you say yes,
      and then you say no.
    </p>
    <p>
      REISACHER. I beg your pardon, Herr Assessor Stroebel. I wanted to say that
      in the Police Department it is like this: Everything you do is all right,
      if it turns out all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [turns back to his desk]. You will never learn to formulate a
      thought precisely.
    </p>
    <p>
      REISACHER [also turns]. All right, Herr Stroebel.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Short pause. Stroebel reads. Reisacher writes. A commotion is heard
      through the middle door, which, is thrown open and Ninon De Hauteville
      enters. Behind her a policeman, who holds her tightly by the arm. She
      tries to free herself.)
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. [she wears a large picture hat, and is highly perfumed]. Keep
      your hands off me. I haven't killed anyone. Please, let me go.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [he has risen]. What's the matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      POLICE OFFICER. [releasing her, stands at attention]. Have the honor sir,
      to report this disreputable woman&mdash;the Hochstetter person.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. Please, help me, sir. I am being handled like the commonest
      criminal.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Why do you keep that hat on? You are not paying us a visit?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. Indeed not! I am not paying a visit. If I lived to be a
      hundred, it would never occur to me to pay you a visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Don't talk so much. Do you understand? [To Reisacher.] Get your
      report book ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. Is this the complaint office? I demand to know at least why I
      was arrested.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Oh, here you'll find that out soon enough. [To the officer.] You
      can go now. [Officer exit through middle door.]
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. Oh, Monsieur, what shameful treatment. I was locked up in a
      cell with two ordinary street walkers. You will help me, won't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [who has crossed over to Reisacher]. Please don't be so familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. I am so helpless. No one will listen to me. No one answers me.
      An awful looking woman brought me a cup of yellow broth and a rusty spoon&mdash;[indicating
      with her hand] so big. "Eat!" she said, and threw it down and left. You
      will see to it, sir, that my friends are notified, won't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [glancing over Reisacher's shoulder]. Your friends cannot help
      you here. [To Reisacher.] Don't make the margin so wide. You are wasting
      good paper. [To Hauteville.] Your friends can do nothing at all for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. You think so, do you? One single word and I'll be set free.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [contemptuously]. Indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. Before the day is over everyone of you will have to apologize
      to me. Yes, before this day is over.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Certainly. [To Reisacher.] The word "Assessor" has two "s" in
      all cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. If you people had the least idea whom you disturbed. If you
      knew whom you compelled to hide in the wardrobe.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [turning quickly to Hauteville]. In the wardrobe? So! [To
      Reisacher.] Make a note of that, Reisacher. [With emphasis.] So someone
      escaped us by hiding in the wardrobe.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. Yes, someone escaped you by hiding in the wardrobe.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [suddenly very friendly.] Upon my word, Madame, I believe that we
      understand each other fully. You are a clever woman. You will not try to
      deny the facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. Not one solitary thing. I am most anxious that you should try
      to find out all.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Bravo! I came near saying that I respect you for that.
      [Benevolently.] You know, Hochstetter, every man is liable to make a fool
      of himself now and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. Indeed they are! I know best what fools men do make of
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Now and then people violate the law. But they ought not to deny
      it afterwards. That's the sad part of it, because we always find out the
      truth in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. I wish you had it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. We have a clue. But you are a woman of character, I admit. I
      take off my hat to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. Indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. I certainly do.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. I was afraid I had lost all refinement after spending the last
      two nights in such company.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [benevolently]. No doubt, it was a trifle hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. It was terrible. They really do make me pay for discreetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Your patrons are the very men who make it so hard for you. They
      get you into trouble and then expect you to protect them. Isn't it so?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. What an experience for me! To have my apartment raided at
      night and be simply dragged away myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. That is too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. I was not even allowed to take along a change of underwear.
      Then I am locked up with women who have every known variety of vermin.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. And with all that they expect you to remain silent!
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. When I want to comb my hair, the matron gives me a comb which
      these women have been using a whole week.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. That simply can't go on,
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. And the air! I never knew that such odors existed on this
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Still you are to shield the others! After all, you know, I think
      that discreetness is just talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. Talk?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. I mean if anybody ever had a moral right to give things away,
      fully and freely, you are that person; ... after all you have suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. That's right. I am that person.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Well then; did somebody escape into that wardrobe?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. Yes, somebody did escape into that wardrobe.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [eagerly]. Who? [Short pause.]
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. [laughs curtly]. Who?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [more sharply]. Who on Saturday night at 10 o'clock escaped the
      search of the police by hiding in the wardrobe?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. [laughs curtly]. It is quite unnecessary for me to tell you
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [sharply]. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. You are certain to find it out ultimately.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Ultimately?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. Even if I wanted to I could not tell! Lord, when a person gets
      strictly accustomed to never mentioning any name, it is almost impossible
      to do it. I, believe that I would have to learn how first.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [shouting]. And you will learn it; I promise you that. You ...
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. Mais Monsieure!
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [shouting]. No "Monsieur" about it. Here you'll talk good plain
      English.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. But why are you getting so excited?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [to Reisacher]. I am nice to this person. I reason with her, and
      she says that she will first have to learn how to expose her crowd.
      [Shouts.] Decency is what you'll have to learn and I'll teach it to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. Oh, not this very minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. I know you. I know your sort! You want to gain time so that you
      can concoct the blackest lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. [calmly]. That would be entirely superfluous. The cleverest
      lie could not help me half as much as the simple truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Out with it!
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. It's better if you find it out through someone else.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. That's your opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. You would only be embarrassed and I would be guilty of a
      breach of confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [with contempt]. As though people confided in such as you.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. I think that they rely upon the fact that our loyalty is not
      "just talk."
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [again calm]. Listen to me. I do not think that you entirely
      understand your position. [Hauteville shrugs her shoulders.] No, I don't
      think that you know at all what is involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. On the contrary it is far worse that you don't seem to realize
      who is involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [quickly]. In what?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. In the wardrobe.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Have you lost your senses? You are a prisoner here. Do you want
      to poke fun at us?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Then don't consider yourself so important with those meaning
      insinuations.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. If I did, I'd soon lose my importance after eating that yellow
      broth from those rusty tin plates.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. And that will continue for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. [energetically]. No, it will not. I tell you right now that I
      will not spend another night in that dirty hole. I will not be mistreated
      any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [with sarcasm]. Of course we are going to ask you for your kind
      permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. I will not remain here. If they think I will let them ruin me,
      they're very much mistaken. This is an outrage and here fair play stops.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. The likes of you and fair play!
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. [bitterly]. Yes, the likes of me. Every day we hear the
      confessions of those very people who publicly show contempt for us. We
      know how false are all virtuous words with which they condemn us, but we
      remain silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Of course, you do all this out of pure sense of fair play? [He
      imitates the motion of counting money.]
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. Money? ... My dear fellow, with money our patrons pay well for
      that very thing which they later on call indecent. You get as much decency
      from us for money as you get from other people, but believe me, we could
      shatter many illusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Well, make a beginning right here.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. It ought to be impossible here. The police have as few
      illusions as we. That is, provided they are properly instructed.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. That's right now, put us in the same class with yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE, Why not? We and the police could easily ruin the credit of
      virtue, but neither of us do it. You&mdash;you because you regard that
      credit as a good substitute for the principal, and we,&mdash;Lord, because
      we need this credit as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Both of us?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. The very moment that public virtue loses its credit, the
      secret vices will drop in market value.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. What are you talking about anyway?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. I'm telling you why both of us must hush things up.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Then you are not convinced that there is a real public morality?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. You mean that morality which you put on with your street
      clothes? I know it well. Gentlemen take it off in my apartment and hang it
      up in my wardrobe, and there I can inspect it very thoroughly. It is truly
      remarkable how our respected gentlemen still make formal social visits in
      costumes which have so often been patched.
    </p>
    <p>
      REISACHER [who up to this point apparently&mdash;without paying any
      attention, has been sitting with his back toward them, turns half way
      round]. Pardon me, Herr Assessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [impatiently]. Now what do you want?
    </p>
    <p>
      REISACHER. Pardon me, Herr Assessor, shall I put all this talk into the
      minutes?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. No, I will dictate to you later. [To Hauteville.] You know that
      you are not here to amuse yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. I know that.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Listen to me quietly. You hinted before that if we kept you here
      another night you would confess everything. Well I tell you here and now
      that we will not keep you here one, but a number of nights. You can ease
      your conscience at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. I would only make yours the heavier for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. My conscience?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. Yes, if I tell you here, there will be no possibility of a
      mistake, but everything must remain a mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. I have patience with you, but I will not let you fool me. Now
      get yourself together and consider every word. What must remain a mistake?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. Everything that has happened since Saturday night.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. All that must remain a mistake?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. It simply must not have happened. No one broke into my
      apartment. No one arrested me. No one compelled anyone to hide in the
      wardrobe.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [shouts.] And no one ever saw such an insolent female.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. This browbeating.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. It is meant for such as you.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. [indignantly stopping her ears]. It reminds one so much of the
      tin plates and the comb.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [angrily pacing the room]. I never heard anything like it.
      Picture it! She makes insinuations as though we had something to be afraid
      of. [He stops pacing and faces her.] You evidently imagine that the whole
      government would run away from you.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. No, but it ran away from your Lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Where?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. Into the wardrobe.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [pacing up and down]. I will bring that fellow out of your
      wardrobe. I will bring him to light. Into bright daylight! [Remains
      standing in front of Hauteville.] What did you say?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILE. Non.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [resuming his pacing']. One of those fine fellows who wallow in
      the mire and then expect us to make exceptions. [Stops pacing, facing
      Hauteville.] What were you saying?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. Nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Sad enough that now and again a halfway decent person strays
      into your place.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. He can only regret that he was disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [goes quickly to desk and unlocks a drawer]. Besides, do not
      deceive yourself. We do not need your disclosures. [He takes out a rather
      bulky paper, a school composition book, and holds it triumphantly in the
      air.] There; do you recognize this?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. [quietly, without a single trace of surprise]. It looks like
      my diary.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. It is your book. It was found in your desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. [very calm]. The desk was locked,
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. It was broken open. Well? What about your loyalty now?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. [shrugs her shoulders]. I kept it. I haven't a fire-proof
      safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [contemptuously]. Would you by chance like to show me the name?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. What name?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Of the gentleman in the wardrobe.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. [laughs]. His name really is not in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Do not evade but show me.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. Oh, there are parties whose names are not in the Hotel
      Register. They travel incognito.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [persuadingly]. Hochstetter, I have an impression that you are
      not such a stupid girl, and I believe that you would like to [pointing to
      the diary] take good care of your&mdash;patrons. If you do not immediately
      reveal the name of that man, I will summon the whole bunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. [shrugs her shoulders]. That's something I cannot stop you
      from doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. What then is your belief in fair play?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. I never submitted that diary to you. You could not have gotten
      it from me voluntarily, but it quite suits me that the officer found it in
      my desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. Because he might have searched for it in the wardrobe.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Now my patience is at an end. [Presses the button on his desk.]
      I will have no consideration for anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUTEVILLE. After all, perhaps you will. For yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Police officer enters.]
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Take this woman downstairs, [The officer leaves with Hauteville.
      Stroebel sits down, pushes the chair angrily to the desk, then gets up and
      throws the diary and several other books on the desk, saying to himself:]
      Never heard anything like it! Such impudence!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Reisacher looks at him with amusement. A knock at the door.]
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [formally]. Come in!
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [enters hastily from the left. He breathes heavily. He has a
      handkerchief in his hand, with which he frequently mops his brow]. Is this
      the proper department at last? I am being sent all around the building.
      [Breathing heavily.] I hope I am finally in the proper bureau.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. What do you want?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Pardon me for a moment while I catch my breath. I climbed twice
      to the third floor and again down to the ground floor. The Commissioner
      sent me to room 147 and there they told me to go to room 174.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Who sent you?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [taking a deep breath]. The Commissioner. I really wanted to
      speak to him personally, but he told me I should go to the gentleman who
      has "Morality." Are you the gentleman who has all the morality?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. At last. [Mopping his braze.] Good God? when a matter is so
      urgent and so much depends on it they ought not to chase one all over the
      building. I must rest a bit. All this excitement and running up and down
      stairs.... So you are the gentleman who has the matter in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. What matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. On Saturday night a lady was arrested. A Madam de Hauteville,
      and certain papers were taken from her. Have you those papers here?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. What business is that of yours?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. My name is Beermann; Fritz Beermann, the banker. I am the
      Chairman of the Society for the Suppression of Vice.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [very politely]. Oh, indeed! Pardon me! I didn't recall your name
      immediately, but I was expecting you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [startled]. You&mdash;were expecting&mdash;me?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. The Commissioner said that you would undoubtedly call on us.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. He said that I undoubtedly would call? But he never mentioned a
      word to me about that, and I saw him just a moment ago. Perhaps after all
      it will be better if I go down to see him again?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. That is not necessary. I have full charge of the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Oh, yes, quite right; you have charge of the matter. And you
      have those writings here too?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. The diary? [He indicates the desk.] Here it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [peeps anxiously over]. Then it is a regular diary?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Quite correctly kept. Gives date and names. Even little jesting
      remarks about the people concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [shouts]. But that is an unheard of insolence!
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Why does she write such things? To what purpose? Can't she
      herself realize how dangerous it is? Fancy, a woman whose whole stock in
      trade is secrecy, keeping an address hook of her patrons. Confound her!
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. But to us as evidence it is priceless.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. I ask you&mdash;why does she record such things?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. We can only be glad of it, Herr Beermann.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. We?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. She'd lie. I tell you she'd deny everything, and that puts an
      end to the case. [Holding the diary in the air.] But here we have the
      whole bunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. As though she wanted to turn State's evidence ...
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Let her just come to court with her confounded fine talk.
      [Imitating Hauteville's manners.] "It simply must not have happened." I
      will drive her to the wall with what happened. We will simply bring up
      those fellows, one after the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [dismayed]. To court!
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Certainly, and that means; hand on the Bible and swear. Then we
      shall see if "no one compelled anyone to hide in the wardrobe."
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. How?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. They will not commit perjury.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. That's utterly impossible!
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. I will make it quite warm for that man, in any event.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. But, Counselor!
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [clinking heels]. Assessor Stroebel.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. But, Assessor, that is simply impossible. You do not want to
      ruin the family life of the entire city, do you?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. In what way?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Do you expect a respectable gentleman to appear in court and in
      the presence of all people to say, yes; it is true that I ... and so
      forth?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [shouting]. But they are all respectable fathers of families!
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. But, my dear Herr Beermann, what difference does that make to
      me?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. It must make a difference. It makes a difference to everybody at
      all times.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. I assure you that I am not a bit sentimental.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [glancing over to Reisacher]. Could we have a few words together,
      alone?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. If you wish it. Reisacher, finish your police report in the
      outer office.
    </p>
    <p>
      REISACHER. Certainly, Herr Assessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Takes several sheets of paper and goes out through the middle door.)
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Do have a seat, Herr Beermann.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Beermann sits down on the sofa. Stroebel does likewise.)
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [mopping his brow]. A personal question, Herr Assessor, are you
      married?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. I thought not. If you had a family you would not speak in that
      fashion of sentimentality.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. If I had a family, I would not, to begin with, be involved in
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. But ...
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. My name would not appear in the diary of Hauteville.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. You never can tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Excuse me. What is there left of family life when such things
      happen?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. What do you mean? If nobody finds it out?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. But such a man must live constantly under a deception.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. My dear Assessor. If the white lie ceases in married life, the
      couple drifts apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. I cannot believe that!
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [persuadingly]. Take my word for it. In every happy marriage the
      parties lie to each other to keep their affection from cooling.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. But both of them remain faithful.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Not in the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Don't say that!
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Not in the least; anyhow not to the very letter. A husband is
      true to his wife even if he ... and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Your views surprise me.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. This is what I mean. He is true in his own fashion. He remains
      kind to his wife, takes a good care of his family, and that is the
      principal thing. That other which you have in mind is only an ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Ideals are lived up to.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Well, yes. But if we don't live up to them, we at least respect
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Herr Beermann, I am astounded. You are the President of the
      Society for the Suppression of Vice?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Can I help it that I was elected?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. But at least you represent the views of your Society. I thought
      you came here for that reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. For what reason?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. To express your satisfaction at our discovery of the business of
      this person.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. You thought I came here on that account?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Didn't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [mopping his brow with his handkerchief]. You'll have to pardon
      me, Herr Assessor; I am still affected by that running up and down stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Perhaps our conversation tires you?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Don't mention it. I simply cannot follow you so quickly, A
      moment ago you mentioned a diary, didn't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Of this Hauteville woman.&mdash;Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Have you been through this diary?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. No. I have not had time yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. But you just spoke about some jesting comments in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Only those I noticed in glancing through it.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [relieved]. Ah!
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Besides, I must tell you, Herr Beermann, that the contents of
      this book must remain a secret to you. My orders are not to show it to
      anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. No, no. I don't want to know anything about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. You will find out everything later when the matter comes up in
      court.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [dismayed]. Will it be read there?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Certainly. To-day I can only tell you that we will proceed
      vigorously. You can satisfy your society on that point.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [rising]. But that doesn't satisfy me at all. Think of the
      consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [rising also]. What do you care about the consequences. Your
      society has its very high aims. Your propaganda states that you will
      prosecute the outcast of society with iron energy and now you see your
      ideals realized.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Our propaganda states that we will intervene from national,
      moral and social viewpoints, to protect the marriage vows. If this scandal
      becomes public the marriage relationship will be undermined.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. What sort of moral viewpoint do you call that?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. It is the Society's. Don't you understand that the influential
      class of society will be involved!
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Then that class will have only itself to blame.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. That's out of the question. We must find a loop-hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Within the scope of the law there are no loop-holes.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Don't tell ME that. Well then, go around the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [surprised]. Herr Beermann!
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Of course! I have lived long enough to know that.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. I shall do my duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Am I interfering with your duty? I belong to that class of
      people who respect the police only because the police respect our social
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. I appreciate that.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. I also take part in political life. I am a candidate for the
      Reichstag and as such I have a decided opinion about these matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Without doubt, Herr Beermann.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Well then, there are, in extreme cases, ways around the law, and
      there must be.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. I am of a different opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. God knows, it is not the business of the police to provoke this
      enormous scandal. All authority will be destroyed. It will shatter the
      respect of the masses for the people higher up.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. But this scandal was provoked&mdash;[knocking on the diary with
      his finger]&mdash;by these very people.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. If a man once in a while goes into a certain room&mdash;that is
      no scandal. It only becomes a scandal when the story is made known to
      every Tom, Dick and Harry. That's what must be prevented!
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. I value the humane motive which evidently is prompting you, Herr
      Beermann. But you must admit that we are acting entirely in accord with
      the views of the classes you mention.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. You are not!
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Yes, we are. Two weeks ago the good people here founded a
      Society because they felt it was necessary to proceed more severely
      against public immorality ...
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN.... Against immorality in the lower strata where it easily
      degenerates into licentiousness. As the President of this Society, I, at
      least ought to know what was intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Even Frau Hochstetter belongs to the lower strata. If we are now
      stepping on anybody's corns, I am very sorry....
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. The police have no business to do anything they will be sorry
      for later on. Good Lord, had the Commissioner only listened to me. An
      affair like this should not be treated in such a purely business-like way.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. The Commissioner can only tell you the same thing. He cannot
      change the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Anything can be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Not at this stage. We could probably have prevented it had we
      known that this case would have such far-reaching consequences, but now
      here are the proofs. [Pointing to the diary.] No one in the world can
      destroy them, not even the Commissioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Then what do you propose to do with them?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. They are going down to the District Attorney's office. The
      avalanche is on its way.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. And we have simply to wait and watch what it hits? (Telephone
      bell rings.)
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Pardon me a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Goes to the right to the telephone. While Stroebel is answering the
      telephone, and has his back to Beermann the latter crosses to the desk and
      tries to look into the diary. Timidly he opens it several times but shuts
      it again quickly, when he fears that Stroebel will turn around.)
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [answering the telephone]. Police Department.... Assessor
      Stroebel speaking. Who is this please ... yes, this is Assessor
      Stroebel.... Yes, Commissioner ... [pause] I understand you, I will remain
      in the office ... Yes, I examined the Hochstetter woman.... Yes, this
      Madame Hauteville [pause] I will remain in the office until you call....
      Yes, Commissioner. Good-bye. [He hangs up the receiver.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [Energetically closes the book and tries to appear indifferent.]
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Now you can convince yourself, Herr Beermann, the Commissioner
      himself is following up this matter. He wants to have another conference
      with me about it to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Am I to wait helplessly until the catastrophe happens?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. You must be consistent....
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. It is possible that my best friends, acquaintances or relatives
      are involved ...
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. You must remain consistent. Doesn't this splendidly justify the
      founding of your Society?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [in a rage]. Oh, leave me alone with your stupid Vice Society.
      Are we not all human, after all!
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. I do not understand you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Do you realize what severe pangs of conscience I suffer? Last
      night as I pictured to myself all that is about to happen, all these
      family misfortunes, I asked myself this question: What really is morality?
      And ... I could not find the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Although you are ...
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Although I am Chairman of the Society for the Suppression of
      Vice, yes, sir. Then I asked myself this: which is the more important:
      that we are moral, or that we seem moral?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Have you found the answer?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. I have. I have become fully convinced that it is far more
      important for the people to believe in our morality.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. But you didn't need a Society for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Yes, we did. Just to be moral is something that I can accomplish
      in my room by myself, but that has no educational value. The important
      thing is to ally one's self publicly with moral issues. This has a
      beneficial effect on the family and state.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. I daresay that this side of the question has not occurred to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Just consider. Morality holds exactly the same position as
      religion. We must always create the impression that there is such a thing
      and we must make each other believe that each of us have it. Do you
      suppose for one moment that religion would last if the church dealt
      publicly with our sins? But she forgives them quietly. The State ought to
      be just as shrewd.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Many a thing you say seems quite true.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. It is true, you can depend upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Theoretically perhaps. But that does not change it one bit. As
      long as the law prescribes it, these offenses [pointing to the diary] must
      be dealt with publicly.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Although you know that thus public decency will be undermined.
      [Stroebel shrugs his shoulders.] Although the State will suffer by it?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [again shrugs his shoulders]. Well ...
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. The Administration knows very well the sort of conservative
      element there is in the Society for the Suppression of Vice.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Yes, and values it highly.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Let us suppose&mdash;I do not know if it be so&mdash;but let us
      just suppose that only one member of the Society once had a weak little
      moment and his name were in this book ...
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [energetically]. Then he would be summoned to court without
      regard or mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. And the whole Society would be made ridiculous and would go up
      in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [shrugs his shoulders]. Well ...
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [shouts]. That is the height of folly, I tell you!
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [instructively]. It is the fulfilment of our duty. You are a
      layman. With you sentiments play an important part. We, the police, on the
      other hand are compelled to sacrifice our feelings to our duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [holding his hands to his ears]. Oh, stop that!
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Official duty blocks our way.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [angrily]. But even a jackass can jump over blocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [offended]. Her? Beermann, I did not hear that remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Let me tell you something! Do you know what we have been doing
      for the past three weeks? ... Talking ourselves hoarse in order to bring
      about an election friendly to the present administration. For the past
      three weeks it has been nothing but Fatherland, and the state and
      religion! And this is your gratitude! In the devil's own name&mdash;just
      picture it to yourself&mdash;a man who has been fighting the opposition in
      thirty different political meetings might be involved in this.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [shrugs his shoulders]. What can I do?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Is the Administration going to deliver him over to his
      opponents?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. We would be very sorry for him, but we would have to summon him
      to court.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Without regard or mercy&mdash;? [Telephone bell rings loudly.]
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Pardon me for a moment. [Stroebel goes to the telephone and this
      time he turns completely around so that his back is toward Beermann.]
      Police Department ... yes ... Commissioner; this is Stroebel at the
      telephone.... [Short pause.] When she was arrested? ... When she was
      arrested there was Lieutenant Schmuttermaier and an officer.... [Short
      pause.] Just one policeman ... [Pause.] ... Yes, Commissioner [short
      pause] I should tell that Lieutenant [short interruption] jackass
      Schmuttermaier to come over to the office immediately.... [Short pause.] I
      shall wait for you until you come.... Yes, Commissioner. (During this
      telephone conversation Beermann steps near to the desk. With a shaking
      hand he takes up the diary but quickly puts it down again. Then he picks
      it up again and with a rapid and energetic movement puts it into his
      breast pocket. Stroebel with a rebuked demeanor goes from the telephone to
      the desk. Beermann turns around so that Stroebel cannot see his face. He
      is disturbed and coughs in order to hide his embarrassment. Stroebel
      presses a button on Reisacher's desk.)
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [while coughing]. I realize now that nothing more can be done. I
      shan't take up your time.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [anxiously]. No, no, please remain. The Commissioner himself will
      be here in a moment. Then you may talk to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. But you just told me that there was no use waiting....
      [Reisacher enters through center door.]
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [urgently to Reisacher]. Reisacher, go and look for Lieutenant
      Schmuttermaier immediately. If he is not in the building, send to his home
      or telephone for him. Leave word that he must come over immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      REISACHER. Yes, Herr Assessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Goes out quickly through center door.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. You said yourself that there would be no use. I guess I'd better
      go.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [perturbed]. But do wait for the Commissioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. There is no use in my waiting. I ... I did all I could ... there
      seems to be no use ... well then.... Good-bye!
    </p>
    <p>
      [About to go through door on left but the door is quickly opened and the
      Commissioner appears with Baron Schmettau. The former holds the door open
      for the Baron. After they have come in, he shuts the door.]
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER [to the Baron]. If you please, Herr Baron.... [To Beermann].
      Ah ... here is our President of the Society for the Suppression of Vice.
      [Beermann bows slightly&mdash;Commissioner continuing contemptuously.]
      Well, have you accomplished your mission? [Beermann nods.] Are you
      satisfied with this arrest or would you like to have us do more?
      [Angrily.] Once for all, Sir, I forbid you to meddle with the affairs of
      this office. You can preach your principles wherever else you like, but
      here I will stand for no interference. [Beermann timidly creeps along the
      wall, and bows himself out.] [Commissioner to Baron Schmettau.] Whenever
      the police bungle anything, look for reformers.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. [with a glance at Stroebel]. Will you introduce me?
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. Assessor Stroebel,&mdash;Freiherr von Schmettau, Adjutant to
      his Highness, Prince Emil. [Stroebel clicks his heels together and bows
      deeply. Schmettau thanks him curtly.]
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER [sharply]. Herr Assessor, I have asked Herr Baron Schmettau
      to come with me in order that in his presence I might correct a pitiable
      lack of tact, which to my regret, and contrary to all my intentions, was
      perpetrated by Lieutenant Schmuttermaier.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. It was abominable.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. What orders did that man have?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [nervously]. Do you mean in the case of Hochstetter,
      Commissioner?
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. Yes, sir, Madame de Hauteville, Who made the raid on her
      apartment?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. The raid?
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. I hope before you arrested her you informed yourself exactly
      with whom you were dealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Certainly ...
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER.... And the result?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. I ascertained that this woman was violating public decency.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. I am going to ask you, Assessor, as my inferior in office,
      to confine yourself to more direct answers, PLEASE. What did the
      investigation disclose?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. That she received questionable visits from gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. Questionable? Then does Schmuttermaier know who these
      gentlemen were?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. He does not ...
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. No? Didn't he investigate a matter which seemed so
      questionable to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. He just wanted to ascertain that these visits were meant for
      Hauteville.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. So&mdash;? I have some truly competent officials. And who
      and what it was did not bother the man at all?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. I myself thought that that would be found out later.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. There are certain things in the world you would not be
      likely to look for and less likely to find. You have been treating this
      thing as though you were dealing with a common ordinary pickpocket. [To
      Baron Sckmettau.] You see it is just as I told you ... the man did not
      have the slightest idea.... [To Stroebel.] Did this fellow,
      Schmuttermaier, see anyone in the flat or did he hear if anyone was there?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. No, Commissioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER [to Baron Schmettau]. It is just as I told you....
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Furthermore, I have heard since that there was somebody in the
      apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER [quickly]. Who?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. That, I have been unable to find out yet, but Hauteville made
      several insinuations as though someone had been hidden in a wardrobe.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER.[to Baron Schmettau]. To be sure&mdash;someone&mdash;was&mdash;To
      my profoundest regret, His Highness, our beloved Hereditary Prince Emil.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [crushed]. I ... didn't have the slightest idea ...
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. You people ought to have an idea once in a while. If this
      Schmuttermaier had any ability, it would not have happened. But it is the
      old story, not a trace of independent ability and tact.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. I don't know what apology I can offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. Neither do I. Besides Herr Baron Schmettau himself was
      obliged to go through this very unpleasant incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. [Schmettau speaks very precisely but puts a slight emphasis on
      his s.] I was completely dumfounded. I cannot understand how it could
      happen. Just picture it ... Lord knows ... I was and am of the opinion
      that our young Highness must learn to know life. Faith, it is not my
      business to act as his pastor....
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. If you please, Herr Baron, that goes without saying....
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. That of course is merely my opinion. I am a man of the world
      and of affairs. I consider it fitting that his Highness should learn to
      know life....
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. But I entirely share your opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. A moment ago the word "decency" was used. In my position I can
      listen to such words from the pulpit, but outside of the church I deem
      them entirely out of place.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER [to Assessor]. You used that expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. If anyone wants to claim that my bearing is not a proper one,
      he will have to prove it with a revolver in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. I did not think that the word would offend you.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. It did offend me. Such expressions are fitting in an asylum for
      feeble-minded people. They should never be used to characterize the
      recreation of Cavaliers.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. May I put in a good word for my Assessor? It certainly was
      not his intention to offend you.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. It was not his intention. [To the Assessor.] Then I will assume
      that it was never said. [The Assessor clicks his heels.] I am somewhat
      nettled but you cannot be surprised at that. You can imagine with what
      care I undertook this task. This Madame de Hauteville was recommended to
      me by reliable parties. She has good manners and does not talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. In her way, she certainly seems a very decent person.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. Absolutely. Since it was my belief that His Highness must learn
      to know life, I could not find a better place. [To the Commissioner.] We
      understand each other?
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. Certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. Every guarantee against vulgarity; everything tip-top. Now
      picture it to yourself. I do all a man possibly can and this inconceivably
      awful scandal happens.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. It is the old story. These people have no tact.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. That doesn't help me any. I am not trying to mix in your
      business. That never occurred to me. But this does not help me one bit.
      The whole blame attaches to me. I simply will be told that such things
      should not have happened. That is an unheard of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER [to Assessor]. For which you are to blame.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. Had I a suspicion that this was contemplated, I would have
      informed you.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. If you only had!
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. Who would think of such things? We all take it for granted that
      the police first of all respect protection!
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. On my word of honor Herr Baron. Not even in my dreams did I
      think of an occurrence like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. [squares his shoulders]. Is it so difficult for you to think?
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. That's just what I say. If a man knows his work thoroughly
      these things come to him. But people who are interested in the uplift
      movements are always in the clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. This Lieutenant or whatever that fellow was, behaved as though
      he was collecting material for a socialist newspaper. His Highness was
      hardly in the house five minutes when there was a loud ringing. Then,
      someone in heavy shoes ran up against the door like a drunken sailor.
      Madame de Hauteville breaks into the room and cries, "Your Highness, how
      unfortunate I am. The police are here," she says. "Leave them alone," I
      say, "they will go away presently." "Impossible," she says, "I can never
      permit His Highness to be found by the police in my place. I will take the
      blame upon myself entirely." Fancy the tact of that woman! "Impossible,"
      she says, "that His Highness should be caught in my place."
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. Really, very decent!
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. Indeed it is. Immediately it dawns on me that she is right. The
      situation is getting terrible. That policeman is likely to demand His
      Highness' identification. What shall we do? Madame says, "For Heaven's
      sake hide in the wardrobe!" Outside, that fool is making quite a rumpus.
      He knocks, rings, shouts and barks. The neighborhood is getting aroused
      and heads are popping out from right and left and in the midst of this
      terrible commotion, there we stand&mdash;Highness and I. What shall we do?
      A few moments later, His Highness is cramped beside me in the wardrobe, in
      between different pieces of woman's apparel. With great difficulty we are
      able to draw our breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. If I had only had an inkling about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER [angrily]. The police are expected to grasp conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. Then what followed? In heavy-nailed shoes the men go from room
      to room. Doors are opened and slammed. The fellows use loud and coarse
      language, and three or four times they stand in front of the wardrobe.
      Upon my word, I actually feel how His Highness is perspiring. Just picture
      to yourself the situation if that brute had opened the closet! Just
      picture that and you can realize how much courage I had!
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. You must have suffered terribly.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. What I suffered does not matter. In such moments one does not
      think of anything else but Highness. What an outrage! Finally the steps
      disappear. Madame Hauteville, who throughout behaved most decently and
      whose conduct was above reproach, is led away and Highness and I can leave
      the wardrobe where we spent an entire twenty minutes. And now I ask again,
      "How can such mistakes happen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER [to Assessor]. You shall find the answer to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. Upstairs the woman is still in her cell. The newspapers are
      full of the scandal, and Highness suffers agonies when he realizes the
      possibilities which can develop at any moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. Herr Baron, you need not worry any longer. Now I am taking
      the matter entirely into my hands. [Consulting his watch, he speaks with
      affected calmness.] It is now a quarter to one. This evening at eight
      o'clock Madame de Hauteville will be set free and everything will be so
      arranged that her discharge will arouse no suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. But how are you going to do it ...?
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER. The details of this arrangement are your affair.

      ACT III
    </h2>
    <p>
      (Beermann's library. Elegantly furnished. A desk is backed up against a
      large bay-window on the right. Opposite is a large book-case, and next to
      this a sofa. A long double door with small French panes somewhat to the
      left. On the left of stage a small table and a few comfortable leather
      chairs. On the right a simple door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beermann enters through the middle door. He goes to the desk, unlocks a
      drawer and takes out the diary of Hauteville. He looks carefully about
      him, then picks out a volume of an encyclopedia from the book-case, opens
      it quickly and places the diary inside. He seats himself and begins to
      read. At this moment the center door is opened slowly, and Frau Beermann
      stands on the threshold.)
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. Are you alone, Fritz?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [frightened, slams the book so that the diary is concealed in
      it]. Goodness, you did frighten me!
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. I did not know how nervous you were until yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Oh, what, nervous? I am over-worked and irritable. Every single
      day, I have to prepare a new speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. Is it in that work that I disturbed you? Pardon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Do you want anything?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. I just wanted to have a few serious words with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. But not necessarily at this moment. To-morrow or ...
    </p>
    <p>
      EFFIE. [opening the glass door, calls in]. Oh, papa, did you forget?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [uneasily]. Forget what?
    </p>
    <p>
      EFFIE. [entering]. Weren't we to see the Indian dancer to-day?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Well, it can't be done to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      EFFIE. That's a shame; I wanted so much to see her and to-night is her
      last appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Then we will wait until the next one comes along.
    </p>
    <p>
      EFFIE. I don't see why just we have to have this bad luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [with emphasis]. Because I have more important things to do than
      to watch your hop, skip and jump.
    </p>
    <p>
      EFFIE. [jolly]. Oh, aren't you cranky?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. I am not at all disposed for such nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      EFFIE. [going over to the desk, picks up the volume of the encyclopedia.]
      All this comes from your politics; now I will simply confiscate your
      ammunition.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [excited]. Give me that book.
    </p>
    <p>
      EFFIE. [jumping away]. No, no, papa, you will only get sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [shouts]. I forbid these stupid jokes. Put that book down.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. What is the matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. I never could tolerate disobedient children, that's all.
    </p>
    <p>
      EFFIE. [placing the book on the desk]. Oh, pardon me, papa.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [grasps the volume tightly and places it in the book-case]. All
      fooling has its limits; don't forget that.
    </p>
    <p>
      EFFIE. Now I suppose as a punishment, we can't see the dancer.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Really I would rather go with you than&mdash;sit here, but it is
      absolutely impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. Go now, darling; I must talk to papa alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. But I haven't the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN [positively]. That much of it you have.
    </p>
    <p>
      EFFIE. Good-bye, papa dear. [Goes out.]
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN [Seats herself on the sofa next to the book-case. Beermann
      stands leaning with his back against the desk. Through the large window
      the evening sun can be seen so that Beermann's face is in its light, while
      Frau Beermann sits in the half-dusk.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Lena dear, do we really have ...?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. We do.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Can't it be postponed?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. I have postponed it many a year, but now it is high time.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. [disturbed]. Many a year? What are you referring to?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. I have a request to make to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. With pleasure....
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. Don't make a laughing-stock of your family.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. In what way?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. Don't make a laughing stock of your family, I beg you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Please don't talk in riddles.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. These are not very great riddles to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Speak plainly, won't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. No. I am not going to speak more plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. As your husband, I demand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. N-no.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. That is very sad. There should be no secrets at all between
      husband and wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. Is this a principle again? Fancy all these great secrets!
      [Beermann shrugs his shoulders.] No. Now take it for granted that I know a
      thing or two about you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [with anxiety]. You?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. Several things. Some which you must know only too well.
      After all, that principle of yours has not been violated. There remain no
      secrets whatever between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. I assure you I shall not rack my brains about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. Nor would I want you to regard me as sitting in judgment on
      your acts.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [with a false pathos]. Instead of telling me freely and frankly
      of the gossip you have heard about me; then I could defend myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. That is just what I want to avoid. To me it appears
      somewhat childish when a man tries to justify ...
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [just as before]. In this manner, the lowest gossip can destroy
      the happiness of any family.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN [seriously]. Fritz, really, there is no one listening to us
      just now.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. You are not taking me in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. No, and it is our good fortune that I am not. At least, my
      good fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. You call that good fortune? I might have expected something
      different from you.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. No, sir, you did not. If you will be honest with me, you
      will admit that. This many a year, we have been playing a common farce.
      You acted the true Christian head of the family and I the all-believing
      audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. How nice!
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. Not nice but it's true. Perhaps the fault is not entirely
      ours, for we learned it from our parents. You men are supposed to impress
      us with your greatness and we women are to stand by and admire.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Do you find that impossible?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. Even the best Christian family principles must have some
      foundation. What was I supposed to admire?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. You ask that now?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. Perhaps I gave it up sooner than others. But that is due to
      our relationship. We were always together. Where is a man to get pose and
      character enough to last him for twenty-four hours every day?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. So that is about your conception of our married life?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. That is it exactly.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. And after all the years ...
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. I acquired it rather early.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Now, after twenty-six years you declare that you are unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. No, Fritz, it has not led us to unhappiness. There has been
      no sudden shattering of an ideal. Our marriage was not an ideal and ...
      don't feel offended ... your personality was never so immaculate, that one
      stain more or less would spoil the effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [excited]. But there must be some sort of reason back of all
      these reproaches?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. If you think them reproaches, then we do not understand
      each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. What else are they?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. I meant it merely as a request. Do not bring your family
      into ridicule.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. You are playing hide and seek all the time. In what way am I
      likely to do that?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. With your moral priesthood to which you have absolutely no
      right.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. No right?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. Not the slightest one. But you are creating enemies who
      will make a laughing-stock of us all, if they find out certain things.
      Those things can be found out whether we like it or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [forced laughter]. Lena dear, I believe you are jealous.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN [quietly]. Jealous, of what? [Short pause.] I hope that you
      credit me with at least good taste enough not to be jealous of my
      so-called right, and ... otherwise what can I lose? No, Fritz, I am not
      jealous. [Short pause, it is getting darker.] I had to get accustomed to
      it; that's true. This secrecy, the petty lies and the false gravity
      irritated me a little bit too much at first, but I made an effort so that
      I could still retain a feeling of comradeship. I overcame it daily,
      because&mdash;well because I never really took you seriously. [Pause.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [with, a false pathos]. Lena, dear, do you realize what things
      you are saying?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. Yes, fully.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [as above]. That is dreadful. Every word is a ... catastrophe! I
      have until today, I have until this hour, believed in our established
      quiet happiness. Now shall all this pass away?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. Nothing but your confidence in my blindness shall pass
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Think it over. There can be no real family life after people
      lose faith in each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. Oh, a person gets used even to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. No. Lena, listen. Someone has been telling you tales and I
      cannot defend myself, because I don't know what I am accused of. You must
      tell me everything right now. I demand it of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. If I wanted to do that, I would have to begin "many, many
      years ago ..."
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Well, why didn't you do it then?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. You can well understand, I had my reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. For such silence there can be no reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. I could shut my eyes and remain silent. That was my
      privilege. But if I had spoken out and permitted you to appease me ... no,
      that was something beyond me. To do that I would have been obliged to lie
      and for that I, for one, have not the ability. [Beermann makes a motion.]
      No, do not interrupt me. These things will have no consequences as long as
      I do not wish them to, but if I should name them, then they would have.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Then shall I let this suspicion rest upon me?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. How coldly you speak. If what you suspect were true, you could
      not be so indifferent about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. Do the by-laws of your society prescribe that in cases like
      these the wife shall be unhappy?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Imagine! The many years that you and I have lived together and
      you had these suspicions right along and never said a word about them. Why
      do you speak today?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. Because you have reached the point where our friendship for
      one another may break. Everything I see and hear from you now hurts me.
      You speak in a tone of strictness, which must be unpleasant even to you.
      For weeks past there has been nothing around me but lies. What you say to
      me, all that you say to the children, and what you preached here publicly
      last night. Every word hurts my ears and urges me to contradict you; I am
      silent and by doing that I endorse your lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. But, Lena ...
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. Finally when your every glance is artificial, each motion
      of yours is a pose. Then it is unbearable. Add to that my anxiety for our
      children. How shall they still retain faith in us, if through an accident
      their eyes are opened? I had remained silent all this time for their sake
      and now you are inviting the whole world to speak. I cannot continue to
      live this life of worry and hypocrisy. All that I have already overcome
      awakens again and appears to me more ugly than ever before. I do not know
      if I can still believe in your good fellowship and remain your friend.
      [She rises and goes slowly to the door.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. I do not seem to know you any more. During our entire married
      life, you have not spoken as seriously as in the last fifteen minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. That perhaps was my great mistake. But I have paid for it.
      [She opens the door.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Lena dear, have you nothing further to tell me?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRAU BEERMANN. I just beg of you; do not bring your family into ridicule.
      [Exit.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [For a while remains standing; lost in thought; then he turns on
      the electric light, sighing, goes over to the bookcase, takes out the
      volume of the encyclopedia wherein the diary of Madams de Hauteville is
      hidden, opens it and reads standing. A knock on the door. Frightened, he
      quickly hides the diary in his side pocket.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Come in. [Justizrat Hauser enters on the left.]
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Lord; good evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [hurrying toward him]. Lord; how glad I am that you have come.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Has anything happened?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. N ... no.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. I received your message that you must see me tonight without fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Yes, I was at your house twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Unfortunately, I was not there. [He has taken off his overcoat and
      is laying it on a chair.] Tell me, you seem to me all upset.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. I am upset.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. I suppose that is why you sent for me. Well, then, what is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Have a seat, please. [They sit down to the left on the sofa.] I
      must begin a little way back.... Have a cigar? [He goes over to the
      humidor, takes out a box of cigars and offers it to Hauser, who takes
      one.] I must begin a little way back ... Can you remember the subject we
      discussed last night?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. The genuinely righteous moral life? [He lights his cigar.] Of
      course, I remember it. Such sermons are not easily forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Do you know I got the impression that you have a rather liberal
      viewpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Liberal?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. I mean that you are not a prude.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. I am an old lawyer, you know, and just out of sheer habit
      contradict people. I made myself blacker than I actually am. So, if you
      have scruples on my account ...
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. I merely mentioned it because you understand life and I must
      speak to someone who judges more liberally than our narrow minded
      bourgeois.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. More liberally than you judged last night?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. I was overzealous, but don't let us talk about it. I want to ask
      you for advice. [Short pause.] You lawyers are bound to respect
      professional secrets?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. We must respect them.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. What I am about to tell you, you will probably find most
      astounding, but it is to be considered absolutely confidential. Even
      though your client confesses a crime, you are not permitted to divulge the
      information?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. What a careful criminal you are!
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. It is possible that you will find this information most
      unpleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER [Bends and talks in a low voice]. Now don't worry about me,
      Beermann. I will know how to protect your interests. The law gives me the
      right to remain silent in any event.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Well then ... [nervously runs his fingers through his hair] I
      really have to begin a little way back. The last few days I have been
      thinking a great deal about monogamy. I am surely the last person to doubt
      the high moral value of the marriage vow, but there is something to be
      said on the other side. It is indeed a very ticklish theme to discuss.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Suppose then that we skip the prologue and the few opening
      chapters and start at once with the affair of Madame Hauteville.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. How do you know ...?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. I suspected. You probably are not the first one who has come to
      confess to me. Since last night many consciences have been jolted. So you,
      too, belong to that crowd?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. You ask yourself how such things are possible?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. No, sir, I never ask myself such stupid questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. You have always believed that an undisturbed happiness prevailed
      in my family.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER [quickly]. Beermann, I resent that! Do not try to make yourself
      interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Don't take it the wrong way. I am not blaming anybody. I just
      want to ...
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. You even want to find moral justification for your immorality.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. I know well enough that it is unjustifiable. I have been saying
      that to myself a hundred thousand times. Do not think that I overcame my
      principles so easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. All you had to overcome was your timidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [sighing deeply]. If you only knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Of course you did not land on the primrose path with both feet,
      but you climbed carefully over the fence&mdash;just as befits a man of
      your embonpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. I expected something better from you than mere mocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. What do you want me to do? Shall I weep because you have sinned?
      Why? What good would it do you? That is the way of your kind. As long as
      no one has proofs against you, your virtue must always be under the
      spotlight, but the very minute you trip up, some peculiar background of
      justification ought to be invented for the smallest sin. No, my dear
      friend. The world's moral system will not go to pieces just because you
      slipped and broke your nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. You cannot realize what suffering you are inflicting upon me
      right now.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Now please don't make long speeches. You did not call me here to
      grant you absolution. You want me to help you to quash this affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [jumps up quickly from his chair]. Yes, you must do that. Good
      Lord, I beg you. I am in a terrible position. You have not the slightest
      idea how nervous I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Will you please sit down and stop exaggerating?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [sits down]. No man living can have sufficient imagination to
      enlarge on this. Imagine it! Any moment the police are likely to come here
      and arrest me.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER [seriously]. Have you been carrying on so badly at Hauteville's?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. No. Not there. That is not worth while mentioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Why then do you fear the police? That's all nonsense. Now just
      consider everything quietly and calmly. By the way, has your wife any
      suspicions ...?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Of this affair? I don't think so. She has just a general one ...
      but what's the use of bothering with trifles! You know that this stupid
      woman kept a diary, and that they found it in her apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Assuredly I know it. Without that diary we would not have so many
      penitents in the City.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Imagine my position. I know positively that my name is in that
      book. It means that I am simply done for by the cursed thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Is it so certain that your name is in the book?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [loudly]. Yes, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. It may be possible that ...
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. It is not at all possible. My name is there. Shall I quietly sit
      and wait until I am ruined? You know that I would be ruined if it became
      public. Fancy, I, the candidate for the Reichstag; I, the President of the
      Society for the Suppression of Vice! All the papers would be full of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Oh, yes, it would be quite interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Then think of the consequences here in the City! In the family!
      Why, I would be killed outright! Lord, how I tried to hammer it into the
      head of that stupid man in the Police Department so he could understand
      what terrible mischief this will make.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER [frightened]. You went to Police Headquarters?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Of course, I was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Did you confess?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. How can you suppose that? [Sits down again.] I spoke for the
      others. I explained to the official that he is showing up the influential
      element; that he is injuring the established order of society,&mdash;but
      [he touches his forehead with his palm] that fellow has nothing but police
      ordinances in his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Shouting will not help us a bit. Remain cool and collected. One
      thing is important, at this moment. Has the diary reached the District
      Attorney's office?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. No, it has not.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Well, as long as it remains in the Police Department there are
      still possibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. It is not in the Police Department either.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Of course it is there. Where else should it be?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [indicating his side pocket]. Here.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER [amazed]. What?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [takes the diary out of his side pocket and places it on the
      table]. Here it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. So, this is the celebrated diary of Madame Hauteville. [Beermann
      nods.] Who gave it to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Nobody. I just took it.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. You mean; you sto ...
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN.... Stole it, yes, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER [pulls back his chair and breaks into a loud laugh]. You did that!
      [He laughs.] ... Say, that's pretty good. Now I am beginning to respect
      you. Confound it, I would never have given you credit for a stunt like
      this. [He laughs and slaps his knee.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Laugh, while I am dying of fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Don't spoil my good impression of you! I am on the point of
      admiring you. [He laughs again.] Let me apologize. I always held you as a
      wishy-washy bourgeois and now you go and pull this thing off.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. You had better give me some advice. I have not had a quiet
      moment since I took the book. I want to destroy it but how can I? If I
      tear it up the pieces will be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Burn it.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Where? There is no fire in the house, except in the kitchen
      range. If I hide it, I shall always have to run to and fro to see if it is
      there, and I feel less safe if I have it on my person. Then I have always
      a feeling as though that thing were bulging out my pocket; and the police
      must be missing it by this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Oh, tear out the page on which your name appears and send it back
      anonymously.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Impossible. My name appears on almost every second page.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Oh ... so.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. What shall I do when the police ask me for the book?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. There is only one way; you know nothing about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. But they will be dead certain that I have it.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Remain firm. For Heaven's sake don't fall into the trap that by
      confessing you will improve this fine job. [A loud and prolonged ringing
      of the electric bell is heard.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [frightened, exclaims]. There, do you hear that?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Some visitor, I suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. This is no time to make visits. [Anxiously picking up the
      diary.] What shall I do with the damned thing? [Takes out a volume of the
      encyclopedia and wants to hide the diary in it but hesitates, and then
      puts the volume back on the shelf.] Lord, where shall I put it?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. Come, give it to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [Gives him the book and Hauser puts it in his side pocket.]
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. No one will search me for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Stay here with me ... please.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER. If it gives you any pleasure, yes; but man alive, pull yourself
      together. Suppose it really were the police; you are trembling all over.
      [A knock on the door.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [crouching]. Quiet now. [Another knock.] Come in. [Betty comes in
      from the left and hands Beermann a visiting card.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BETTY. The gentleman says it is very urgent.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [with a trembling hand Beermann takes up the visiting card and
      reads]. Professor Wasner. [He sighs audibly and then says with forced
      vigor.] Show the gentleman up. [Betty exit.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. And this has been my state of mind for the past six hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAUSER [offering him his hand]. Now be brave, my dear friend, and even if
      they should come to you, just deny it outright. You'll know how to lie. A
      man of such rare abilities.... Good night. [Goes out on the left. In the
      doorway, he almost collides with Professor Wasner. They greet each other.]

    <p>
      WASNER [wears a cape the left corner thrown picturesquely over his right
      shoulder, holds a large slouch hat in his hand. His hair is disheveled.
      His flaxen beard falls on his chest]. I am here in regard to the most
      remarkable matter a man ever came to consult another about.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [very nervous]. Must it be today, Herr Professor?
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER. The situation permits of no delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. But it is getting so late.
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER. I admit that this is hardly the proper time to make visits.
      Nevertheless, I entreat you to hear me. [Beermann seats himself at the
      desk, takes out a large handkerchief and presses it against his forehead.
      Wasner remains standing and continues.] For many years, as you well know,
      I undertook the task of collecting all publications which have been
      undermining public morals. I daresay today, that my collection is most
      complete and that I have unquestionably proven the harm of pornographic
      literature. What corrupting influence this temptation has through
      suggestion and imagination can today no longer be doubted, because&mdash;[an
      impressive pause; Wasner lowers his voice]&mdash;I myself fell a victim to
      it. [Beermann remains in his apathetic attitude. Pause.] I can well
      understand that you lack words. I, too, became, on account of it, much
      disgusted with my character. I asked myself if I still have the right to
      participate in the moral salvation of our people and I have decided
      affirmatively only after a thorough examination. [Pause.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [absentmindedly]. Yes ... yes ... Herr Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER. You are entitled to know everything. Only spare me the details.
      Briefly stated, one day I could not view my collection as objectively as
      usual and thru a friend I was induced to make a most damnable visit. I
      assure you that I simply loathe that fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. But just why are you telling me all this?
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER. Because together we have fought against immorality shoulder to
      shoulder. I ask you if you still deem me worthy to strive for our common
      ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. For my part, go as far as you like, I won't stop you.
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER. Then you will not deny me your assistance?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Suppose we discuss all this tomorrow, Herr Professor?
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER. Tomorrow will be too late. [Beermann falls back into his chair in
      an attitude of apathy.] After my false step I became convinced that it is
      my duty to protect others from this temptation. My feeling of duty became
      stronger until finally I wrote a letter to be exact&mdash;an anonymous
      letter&mdash;to the police, wherein I demanded emphatically that they put
      an end to the misconduct of this person.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [now attentive.] Really that was not nice.
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER. I wanted to assure myself that within I still had the right to
      belong to the Society for the Suppression of Vice.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. I consider that rather mean. You should always be grateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER. This very feeling would have made me feel still more guilty.
      [Beermann shrugs his shoulders nervously.] But now I come to the reason
      for my being here. My information had results ... This creature was
      arrested and today after dinner my false friend comes to tell me that he
      had not been careful, had mentioned to her my name, and I am certainly
      indexed in the book she kept. This book was found in her place by the
      police.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [jumping up]. What's her name?
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER. Hauteville.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. So, it is you to whom we are indebted for this scandal.
      [Angrily.] Do you fully realize what you have accomplished? How many
      respectable fathers of families you have brought to the very verge of
      despair?
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER. I know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. You don't.
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER. I came here for that very reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [not understanding him]. What?
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER. I came here to request you on behalf of the others to call
      tonight, a meeting of the Executive Committee. The Society must do
      everything in its power to keep this case out of court.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Why the devil did you write that anonymous letter?
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER. Listen to me, I beg of you. Someone is involved in this who is
      very dear to you. As soon as I received the information, I hastened to
      Police Headquarters immediately and wanted to intervene there as the
      representative of the Society for the Suppression of Vice. But when I
      mentioned that name I was very formally thrown out. On the steps, whom do
      you think I met but our mutual friend, Kommerzienrat Bolland! He too had
      been in the Commissioner's office and had the same bad luck. I told him my
      troubles and he admitted to me that he also had been lured into the den of
      this Siren.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Kommerzienrat!
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER. Unfortunately. But that is something I can't at all account for.
      He hardly could have been led into temptation through a collection of
      documentary exhibits.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. And what do you want of me now?
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER. Our friend sends me to you. He would have come himself but the
      shock threw him into a sickbed. He entreats you urgently to call a meeting
      of the Executive Committee, immediately. We have very influential people
      in our midst who must bring pressure to bear on the Department of the
      Interior in order to hush up this affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. If only you had not written that anonymous letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER. I felt a moral duty to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. And now it is our moral duty to patch up this matter. [Betty
      enters on the left.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BETTY [hands Beermann a calling card]. The gentleman says it is very
      urgent.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [reads]. "Assessor Stroebel." [Frightened; to Betty.] Tell him I
      am out of town. [Betty about to leave.] No, tell him I am sick&mdash;or,
      Betty, show the gentleman up. [Betty goes out.]
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER. At what time shall the Executive Committee meet?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [excited]. Oh, leave me alone with your Executive Committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER. You must not desert us in our hour of peril. A leader's fate is
      bound up with his followers according to German tradition.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [as before]. It is all your fault anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER. Shall I then tell our sick friend that we cannot count on your
      support?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. If I am so situated that I can, I will be over to see him in an
      hour. I can't promise you more now. [Assessor Stroebel enters on left and
      remains standing in the doorway.]
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [very seriously.] Herr Beermann, I must speak to you privately.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [confused]. You&mdash;with me? Well, since you must, I suppose
      you must.
    </p>
    <p>
      WASNER. Well, I am going. [Wasner exit left.] [Stroebel enters. Wasner
      remains standing on the threshold.] The Executive Committee will be called
      to the sick bed of our friend. We shall await our chairman. [He goes.
      Stroebel and Beermann remain standing, silent, facing each other.]
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. You are surprised, I presume, that I come here at this unusual
      hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Why should I be surprised?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. You will have to pardon me. The matter which brings me here is
      unusual and urgent.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Oh, don't mention it. [A short pause. They both clear their
      throats.]
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. You were in my office this morning ...
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Was I?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Why, of course you were in my office this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Oh, yes, yes. I remember we had a short conference. I must ask
      you to excuse me, Herr Assessor. I am suffering with an awful ringing in
      the ears. It makes me so forgetful.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. But I hope you still remember what we spoke about.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Very dimly. If you would remind me of it perhaps it will not be
      so difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. You came on account of the Hauteville case.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. So-o?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Or the Hochstetter ...
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Well, since you say so, it must be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. First I thought you came to express your satisfaction that we
      had caught this person ...
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. No, that was not my purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. I am sure it wasn't. I was quite surprised that you were not
      satisfied with her arrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Why shouldn't I not be satisfied with her arrest?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [nervously]. But, Herr Beermann, you will recollect how we
      discussed the diary.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [quickly]. A diary? I know nothing about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. You even became quite excited about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. I know nothing whatever of any diary. You never showed me any
      book at all. Of that I am very positive.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [in despair]. It is just my confounded luck to find you in this
      predicament. You are evidently suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. An awful ringing in my ears&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. I would leave you at once if the least delay were possible. But
      I simply must speak to you about it tonight. Can't you get relief by
      taking medicine?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. No medicine can help me. I can only tell you that I do not know
      anything about any diary.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Lord, Lord, leave the diary out of it altogether. It is
      absolutely of no importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. It is of no importance?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Of course, it is safely locked in my desk ...
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Is that so? Well, then I can't understand why you hurried to see
      me tonight.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [very embarrassed]. But that is exactly what I wanted to explain
      to you. But how shall I do it? You scarcely remember any more than that
      you were in my office this morning. It is incredible how misfortune has
      been persecuting me since noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [greatly relieved]. Well, calm yourself, Herr Assessor. It will
      come out right in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [downcast]. No, it can never come out right.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [soothingly]. Sit down nicely in this chair&mdash;so! I'll sit
      next to you here&mdash;so! ... And now let us see about it. [They seat
      themselves on the left, upstage.] Do you know, I am beginning to feel much
      better already. So the diary is in your desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. For my part, let it be buried a thousand feet deep. For God's
      sake, don't talk of it any more. It takes us away from my subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. That's right. We shan't talk of it any more. Now let me see, I
      called on you about the Hauteville case....
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. And on this occasion you demanded that the police suppress the
      matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Quite true, I did that.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. There you are! And that's why I thought you were mostly
      interested in avoiding scandal. BEERMANN. In what way?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Not personally, but from a wholly humanitarian or civic
      standpoint. You even told me that just because of your position as
      President of the Society for the Suppression of Vice, you regarded it as
      your duty to keep this matter out of the courts.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Only for the common welfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. And out of consideration for public opinion. I had the
      impression that these considerations were of great importance to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. And still are. Do you think I change my views? I repeat to you,
      that I would consider this court trial a misfortune because it would be
      contrary to the established order of Society.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Then we are agreed in our principles!
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. You too?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Absolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. I thought that you had ... this forenoon ...
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. And I was also mistaken because you didn't seem to remember. But
      at any rate we agree in our principles. [They shake hands.] Although that
      does not accomplish anything still it is a great relief to me that we
      understand each other. I am coming now to the real purpose of my visit.
      [He clears his throat.] Herr Beermann, I must demand your word of honor
      that not a syllable of what I tell you will ever pass your lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. My sacred word of honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. These are official secrets, perhaps even State secrets, and a
      single careless word might have tremendous consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. You can depend on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Not even to your family.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Not a breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. To tell you: Since you were at my office this morning there were
      most remarkable developments, quite unique in their way. But I have your
      word of honor&mdash;have I not?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. My sacred word of honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [bends low and protects his mouth with his hand and whispers].
      That very night when Madame Hauteville's apartment was raided, without our
      knowledge a very distinguished person was hidden there.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. I can imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [loudly]. You can't imagine it at all. [Whispering.] Our young
      heir, Prince Emil, was there himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [surprised, slapping his thigh]. Now what do you think of that!
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [loudly]. You can understand that I am not telling you this as a
      mere bit of gossip, but certain important reasons compel me to. That which
      you mentioned before about the reasons of state was fulfilled. Fulfilled
      to the very letter. All possibilities of prosecuting this person at
      present have simply gone up in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [starting from his seat]. Then everything is all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. There's nothing "all right" about it. Keep your seat, Herr
      Beermann. Of course our desire to prosecute has disappeared, but the lady
      in question is still at headquarters and we don't know how to get rid of
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Madame Hauteville? [Stroebel nods.] Just forget to lock the door
      and she'll vanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [shaking his head]. No, ... for a great many reasons. Do you
      think I did not try hard to find a solution? First, if we openly permit
      her to escape, the whole city will know it tomorrow; the press will take
      it up and there will be a far greater scandal than the court proceedings
      would cause. No, sir, at least the letter of the law must be carried out.
      Madame Hauteville must give a bond. She will be set free and then she must
      escape. That's the only way we can protect ourselves from criticism. Do
      you understand me?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. You mean ... about the bail?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Yes, sir, the bail first of all. But if it were only the bail!
      Just think! She doesn't want to go at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. She does not want to ...?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. No. I gave her another hearing this afternoon and told her that
      we don't care to bother with her any more. "Listen," I said to her, "you
      are lucky. Give bail of Five Thousand Marks, and you will be free in ten
      minutes. There is a ten o'clock train for Brussels tomorrow morning." [The
      bell in the hall rings.] What do you suppose she said? She laughed. She
      knows very well why we are so humane, but she will not give a bond of five
      marks, even if by luck she had it. She says that she has already prepared
      for a trial. I talked to her politely, then rudely. She will not budge.
      She laughs and laughs and that's all. [Knock at the door. Maid enters with
      a visiting card.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [to the maid]. What does it all mean to-night, at this hour? This
      is not a hotel. [Takes the card and reads.] Freiherr Bodo von Schmettau,
      Herr auf Zirnberg?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Do receive this gentleman, please.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Now, while we are conferring?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Yes, now, if you please.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [to the maid]. Ask the gentleman to come in. [Betty exit.]
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. He is Adjutant to the young Prince. I told him I was going to
      see you, and you can realize how upset he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. If it affords you pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. It does. The entire responsibility rests on me and I at least
      must show that I have left nothing undone. [Knock on the door.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Come in. [Schmettau enters.]
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. Good evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [rising. Beermann rises also]. May I introduce you gentlemen?
      Herr Beermann, the banker&mdash;Herr Baron Schmettau.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. We have already had a glimpse of each other today.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Yes, I remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. You are the President of the Local Morality Club. Before we go
      further I must tell you that I do not at all agree with those views ...
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL [interrupting with anxiety]. Herr Baron, may I call your
      attention to the fact that Herr Beermann, personally, is far above these
      narrow theories.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. I am glad to hear it. Besides as theories they're not so bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. As theories! That's what I say.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. Well, there you are!
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Herr Beermann is also the candidate of the local
      Conservative-Liberal Coalition.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. Then he is certainly no stickler for high-flown notions. I
      should be right glad if we understood each other. And how far are you,
      gentlemen?
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. In principles we are agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Absolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. Then we shall have no difficulty in finding the right solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. I have taken Herr Beermann into our confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. That was a very disagreeable mishap, was it not? Very bad.
      Whoever has any patriotism can realize it.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. Herr Baron was also ...
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. Locked in the closet.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Permit me to revert to the facts. I was just telling Herr
      Beermann that this Hauteville woman refuses to leave. She boasts that she
      has not the bail and even if she had it, she would not pay it.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. Confound her! She controls the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Now we come to the most difficult part of it. She says that if
      she is compelled to leave the city and is deprived of her livelihood, she
      wants proper damages for it. Of course I told the woman that this, to say
      the least, was an extortionate demand. Well then, she says, we will have a
      trial in court.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. The fox! She knows well that's out of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. I am very grateful to you for these sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. I asked what she considered proper damages. "Ten thousand
      marks," she says. I almost lost my senses. With the necessary bail that
      would make Fifteen thousand marks.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. In the end perhaps that is not so gigantic.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Who is going to pay it?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. Not we, of course. Our state is a poor paymaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      STROEBEL. Here is a fine mess, which I cannot solve&mdash;at least not I.
      Herr Beermann, you said yourself that your Society for the Suppression of
      Vice is vitally interested in the undisturbed maintenance of the popular
      belief in morality. For the members of your Society, it ought to be quite
      easy to collect that sum. I know of no other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN [with folded hands he stands in a pensive mood]. The Executive
      Committee is expecting its chairman. And I know of a professor who alone
      ought to pay an extra thousand for a letter he wrote. [To the others.]
      Gentlemen, briefly speaking, I will do it. On behalf of the society, I
      pledge this sum.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHMETTAU. Herr von Beermann, I can only say that you have acted
      honorably. The House of Emil the Benevolent knows on whom to confer an
      order. [He offers his hand.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BEERMANN. But let me assure you, Herr Baron, I did not do it expecting a
      reward.
    </p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
